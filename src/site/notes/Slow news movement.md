# Slow news movement

News that focuses on accuracy and relevance, at the expense of up time and response time. May publish as often as once a week, or as slowly as once a quarter. 

## Why read slow news? Isn't being up-to-date the point?

"Traditional" news is rife with self-feeding problems. Since many people will not pay for news, it is funded by advertising and sponsorships which does not have the viewer's interests at heart. Being funded by advertising means news is incentivised to show as many ads as possible, meaning it prioritises *engagement*, and one of the most effective ways to engage is *outrage*[^2]. This circular dependency means news is saturated with outrageous news that degrades viewers mental health, advertising for products of often questionable quality, and news of such questionable accuracy as to be considered lies[^3]. Some call this postjournalism.

To counter this, slow journalism offers the following:

- **No [[Private/Advertising\|Advertising]]**. Slow journalism is funded in other ways, most commonly from its readers.
- **Infrequent updates**. Ideal for those experiencing [[Concepts/Information overload\|Information overload]].
- **Detail**. Slow journalists are able to create longer content, with more rich media. 
- **Accuracy**. Fact-checking is a labourious and time-consuming process which appears to be skipped in fast-news. Slow-news can spend more time here.

## Examples of slow news

My personal favourites:

- [Works in Progress](https://www.worksinprogress.co/) publishes every few months without a strict schedule. Free to read for all, but differs from the others in that it is funded by Stripe rather than by readers.
- [The Pudding](https://pudding.cool/) publishes online once or twice a month with highly interactive stories. News is free to all, but paid supporters are given merchandise and access to a private Slack channel.
- [Knowable Magazine](https://knowablemagazine.org/) is so good it is hard to believe it's free. Start with one of their highly researched comics, [Why do thieves keep stealing catalytic converters?](https://knowablemagazine.org/article/society/2021/why-do-thieves-keep-stealing-catalytic-converters-its-elemental). Then try one of their collections on [The Working Life](https://knowablemagazine.org/report/special-report-working-life), 

Others of note:

- [Quanta Magazine](https://www.quantamagazine.org) has gorgeous art, diagrams, typography, and huge amounts of research and fact checking. Being mostly science focused, I find myself unable to understand and appreciate the material here, but perhaps you will.
- [Undark](https://undark.org/), in their own words: "Undark is a non-profit, editorially independent digital magazine exploring the intersection of science and society. It is published with generous funding from the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, through its Knight Science Journalism Fellowship Program at MIT."
- [Delayed Gratification](https://www.slow-journalism.com/) publishes once a quarter in both print and digital. Digital costs **£30** / year, print costs **£79** / year for me in the US.
- [Atmos](https://atmos.earth/) publishes twice a year and is available for free
- [[Private/The Guardian\|The Guardian]] has a  [Weekly](https://support.theguardian.com/us/subscribe/weekly) print edition for $27.50USD/month
- [The Point Mag](https://thepointmag.com/) publishes an issue every four months, and offers 3 articles for free before requiring you to purchase a subscription for $3/month.
- [Noema](https://www.noemamag.com/) publishes around twice a year, and offers issues in both print and digital for $20 each.
- [Asterisk Mag](https://asteriskmag.com) is contributed to by *Dynomight*, one of [[My favourite blogs\|My favourite blogs]]. They publish once a quarter, and in their words "is fiscally sponsored by the Effective Ventures Foundation, a registered charity in England and Wales".

## Similar, but not slow news

Non profit news is funded by donations, but may post more regularly than slow news and also supplement funding with advertising.

- [Wikipedia News portal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Current_events) is my preferred sources for learning what's new around the world.
- [Greater Good Magazine](https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/) has many fantastic articles on how to have better relationships and be a better person. One of my favourites is [How curiosity and consent can make old lovers new again](https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/how_curiosity_consent_can_make_old_lovers_new_again). Offers additional perks for donations of $50/year
- [Propublica](https://www.propublica.org/) is a mostly reader funded publication which investigates US abuse of power. Has some ads, publishes a little too often, and feels too aggravating for me to read regularly. But has some excellent articles, such as [how to evaluate a non-profit](https://www.propublica.org/article/how-to-evaluate-charity-before-you-donate).
- [Aeon](https://aeon.co/)'s writing is so good it is comparable to good books - the kind you go back to and reread when you need them. Their articles can run quite long and into difficult material, so you might want to start with something easier, like [The Biography of the Pixel](https://aeon.co/essays/a-biography-of-the-pixel-the-elementary-particle-of-pictures).
- Axios, in particular for me, [Axios Seattle](https://www.axios.com/local/seattle). I like this a lot for being so relevant to me, as well as being reader funded. Additionally, accepts reader corrections and publishes them. Has a high quality daily email newsletter, with no external ads - just ad-like self promotion of itself, such as calls to donate, download its app, or look at its [job board](https://www.axios.com/jobs). Its writing is generally not worth re-reading, but is good for skimming to know what's happening in my area.

Government funded news, or [[Private/State media\|State media]] is funded by taxpayers, so occasionally locks access to geographic IP ranges.
