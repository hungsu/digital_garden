# UI engineering

A branch of [[Unsorted/Software engineering\|software engineering]], specialising in designing and writing code that runs on the end-user's phone or device. This may include but is not limited to:
- UI - buttons, tables, and many other things that a user can interact with. The most common area of UI engineering, and often involves a [[Unsorted/UI design\|UI designer]]
- *animation* - moving 
- *localisation* - displaying different content based on things we know about the user such as their timezone or  language of choice
- calling APIs
- data state

This is in contrast to [[back-end engineering\|back-end engineering]].


## Common mistakes

*Layout shift*: Moving UI elements after displaying them. Causes great distress to users who may begin to interact with an element which then moves, causing errors and reducing user trust in the UI. Can be caused by images loading, and also UI elements changing size.

## Foundational Skills

In addition to skills common to all software engineers, UI engineers should know:

- [[Unsorted/HTML\|HTML]]
- [[Unsorted/JavaScript\|JavaScript]]
- Browser dev tools

## Split between Front and Back

As of around 2015, front end engineering had grown large and complex enough to warrant splitting loosely into two sections: front of the front-end, and [[Digital/Coding/back of the front-end\|back of the front-end]].

It is generally agreed this split exists, but it is not universally agreed what skills exist in each. Some guesses include

| Front                               | Either way                        | Back                        |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| [[Unsorted/Accessibility\|Accessibility]], [[Unsorted/CSS\|CSS]], [[Unsorted/SVG\|SVG]] | [[Unsorted/CORS\|CORS]], routing, [[Digital/Coding/TypeScript\|TypeScript]] | [[Unsorted/CORS\|CORS]], [[Unsorted/UI data model\|UI data model]] |
For those as the Front, [[UI pattern\|UI pattern]]
