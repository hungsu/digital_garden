I refer back to my own [[Private/advice\|advice]] at times, and I make some potentially controversial [[Claims/1. What is a claim\|claims]].

These notes are written using [[Software/Obsidian\|Obsidian]], then published using the [[Software/Digital Garden plugin\|Digital Garden plugin]] by Oleeskild, [[Private/Github\|Github]], and [[Software/Netlify\|Netlify]]. 

I enjoy UI and UX design, especially [[typography\|typography]]. This website is using an Obsidian theme I designed and made myself, called [Typomagical](https://github.com/hungsu/typomagical-obsidian).
