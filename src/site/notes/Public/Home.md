G'day! I'm Hung-Su and these are my notes, in the form of a [[Concepts/digital garden\|digital garden]] üòÄ They are of varying levels of quality, but they're all 100% written by me. You might be curious about [[Why publish notes\|why I publish notes]].

I refer back to my own [[Advice/1. What is advice\|advice]] at times, and I make some potentially controversial [[Claims/1. What is a claim\|claims]].

My oldest hobby is playing [[videogame\|videogames]], usually on [[Gear/my computer\|my computer]]. I'm currently playing [[Videogames/Voidigo\|Voidigo]] and [[Private/Final Fantasy 7 remake\|Final Fantasy 7 remake]]. My life playing games is directly responsible for my present day career in [[Private/Software engineering\|software engineering]].

I thoroughly enjoy note taking and [[Private/Personal Knowledge Management\|Personal Knowledge Management]], using [[Software/Obsidian\|Obsidian]] and Logseq. I did a [Twitch stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jASsctBxZk4) about them once! This website you're reading was made with the [[Software/Digital Garden plugin\|Digital Garden plugin]] by Ole Eskild, [[Private/Github\|Github]], and [[Software/Netlify\|Netlify]]. 

I enjoy UI and UX design, especially [[typography\|typography]]. This website is using an Obsidian theme I designed and made myself, called [Typomagical](https://github.com/hungsu/typomagical-obsidian).

| 2023-Feb-19 | I'm thinking a bit about [[Software/PageSpeed Insights\|PageSpeed Insights]]. This website is based on [[Software/Digital Garden plugin\|Digital Garden plugin]] which gets a Performance score of only `48/100`, on a page with no images.
