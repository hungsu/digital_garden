G'day! I'm Hung-Su and these are my notes, in the form of a [[Concepts/digital garden\|digital garden]] üòÄ They are of varying levels of quality, but they're all 100% written by me. You might be curious about [[Why publish notes\|why I publish notes]].

I refer back to my own [[Advice/1. What is advice\|advice]] at times, and I make some potentially controversial [[Claims/1. What is a claim\|claims]].

These notes are written using [[Software/Obsidian\|Obsidian]], then published using the [[Software/Digital Garden plugin\|Digital Garden plugin]] by Ole Eskild, [[Private/Github\|Github]], and [[Software/Netlify\|Netlify]].
