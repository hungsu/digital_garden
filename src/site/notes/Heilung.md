# Heilung

In 2024, by accident I found myself watching the live performance of *Seidh* at the 2023 Game Awards.

Simply calling Heilung a "band" would do them a disservice. They have a look, a sound, a performance, that together create an experience I have not ever had before. It fills the air, shakes the ground, and it's something I feel from head to toe, but especially in my chest with their booming drums, droning strings, and vocals. I enjoy their sound so much, that their music is permanently part of [[Unsorted/My favourite test songs for speakers and compression\|My favourite test songs for speakers and compression]], and I firmly reject speakers and headphones that are not able to sufficient recreate the full range of their sound. Thankfully [[blog/Linus Tech Tips said I should build my own home theatre\|my home theatre]] as well as my [[Gear/7Hertz Timeless earphones\|7Hertz Timeless earphones]] are mostly up to the task.

Some concert goers talk about Heilung's concerts being like a religious experience, without religion. I am in no position to talk about them, so I would direct you to [this 2023 article](https://www.sonicperspectives.com/concert-reviews/heilung-october-2023/) who does a great job talking about them.
