G'day! I'm Hung-Su and these are my notes, in the form of a [[Concepts/digital garden\|digital garden]] ðŸ˜€ They are of varying levels of quality, but they're all 100% written by me. You might be curious about [[Why publish notes\|why I publish notes]].

My oldest hobby is playing [[videogame\|videogames]], usually on [[Gear/my computer\|my computer]]. I'm currently playing [[Videogames/Baldur's Gate 3\|Baldur's Gate 3]] , [[Videogames/PEAK (2025)\|PEAK]], and [[Videogames/The Spell Brigade\|The Spell Brigade]]. My childhood playing videogames is directly responsible for my present day career in [[UI engineering\|UI engineering]].

I thoroughly enjoy note taking and [[Concepts/PKM\|Personal Knowledge Management]], using [[Digital/Obsidian\|Obsidian]]. I did a [Twitch stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jASsctBxZk4) about them once! This website you're reading was made with the [[Digital/Digital Garden plugin\|Digital Garden plugin]] by Ole Eskild. 

I enjoy UI and UX design, especially [[Concepts/typography\|typography]]. This website is using an Obsidian theme I designed and made myself, called [Typomagical](https://github.com/hungsu/typomagical-obsidian).

| 2023-Feb-19  | I'm thinking a bit about [[Digital/PageSpeed Insights\|PageSpeed Insights]]. This website is based on [[Digital/Digital Garden plugin\|Digital Garden plugin]] which gets a Performance score of only `48/100`, on a page with no images.

| 2022-Jul-27  | I was alarmed by a comment on Hacker News of a person who didn't see the point of linking their notes.
