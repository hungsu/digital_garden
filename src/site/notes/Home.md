G'day! I'm Hung-Su and these are my notes, in the form of a [[Concepts/digital garden\|digital garden]] üòÄ They are of varying levels of quality, but they're all 100% written by me. Generative AI is never used at any part of the process of anything on this blog. You might be curious about [[Why publish notes\|why I publish notes]].

I refer back to my own [[Advice/1. What is advice\|advice]] at times, and I make some potentially controversial [[Claims/1. Claims I've made\|claims]].

My oldest hobby is playing [[videogame\|videogames]], usually on [[Gear/my computer\|my computer]]. I'm currently playing [[Videogames/Necesse\|Necesse]] and [[Videogames/Red Dead Redemption 2\|Red Dead Redemption 2]]. My childhood playing videogames is directly responsible for my present day career in [[Unsorted/Software engineering\|software engineering]].

I thoroughly enjoy note taking and [[Concepts/PKM\|Personal Knowledge Management]], using [[Digital/Obsidian\|Obsidian]]. I did a [Twitch stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jASsctBxZk4) about them once! This website you're reading was made with the [[Digital/Digital Garden plugin\|Digital Garden plugin]] by Ole Eskild, [[Unsorted/Github\|Github]], and [[Digital/Netlify\|Netlify]]. 

I enjoy UI and UX design, especially [[Unsorted/typography\|typography]]. This website is using an Obsidian theme I designed and made myself, called [Typomagical](https://github.com/hungsu/typomagical-obsidian).
