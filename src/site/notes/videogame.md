# Videogames

Videogames are a special kind of experience. They can be artistic, social. They can be aggravating and toxic.

Between videogames, [[TV show\|TV show]]s, [[movie\|movie]]s, [[Private/music\|music]], and [[Private/book\|book]]s, videogames are easily the most impactful pop culture medium in my life, for combining many of the best elements of all the others.

The first videogame I ever played was likely a Pac-Man rip-off when I was around 4 years old, on the family [[Gear/my computer\|computer]].

The game I've spent the most hours on by far is DotA 2, which I can also partially thank for my move to the USA.

The most impactful games on my thinking are [[Videogames/Witcher 3\|Witcher 3]], [[Private/CP2077\|Cyberpunk 2077]].

These days I'm playing indie games, notably [[Private/auto shooter\|auto shooter]]s.
