A multiplayer co-op videogame that took the world by storm in 2025, about rock climbing. In August of 2025, it sold 3.7 million copies, which is more than any other Steam game that month[^1]

At the time of writing, the only game of its kind. I love playing games with my friends, and this is the first time we've been able to play something together that we enjoyed where we don't have to kill anything.

Many games of the past made losing decidedly un-fun. Modern games like PEAK make losing fun, even hilarious. If you have friends to play with, I strongly recommend you try this.
