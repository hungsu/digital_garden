A videogame featuring phenomenal [[Unsorted/typography\|typography]] as a way of communicating character social standing. The game created original Typefaces just for the game, by studying historical texts, which you can read about in great length in the [Lettermatic case study](https://lettermatic.com/custom/pentiment).

I personally didn't finish the game, but I finished Act 2. For engaging mystery games, I preferred [[Videogames/Return of the Obra Dinn\|Return of the Obra Dinn]] and [[Videogames/Case of the golden idol\|Case of the golden idol]].
