# Diablo 4

Diablo 4 is the third Diablo game I've played, having played 1 and [[Videogames/Diablo 2\|Diablo 2]].

I don't remember much of the story of 1 and 2, but I thoroughly enjoyed the story of Lilith and Inarius in the main game. I enjoyed it so much I may consider replaying it to experience it again.

I played the first of Diablo 4's follow up content, Season of the Malignant, hopeful for a great story. It was so very bad that I uninstalled the game to never open again. My sentiment seems to be mirrored by almost all other players.[^1]

The music is incredible, but especially for fans of the older Diablo games. The entire sountrack is easily found on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/1of5HM6vfUTO8ecBEmxLxd), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeSHN5p-ZOQ), and also exists on [vinyl](https://www.amazon.com/Diablo-Original-Soundtrack-Ryan-Amon/dp/B0DKPDNJ3H). My favourite track is [Legacy of the Horadrim](https://downloads.khinsider.com/game-soundtracks/album/diablo-4-original-soundtrack-2023/46.%2520Legacy%2520of%2520the%2520Horadrim.mp3).

If you are an extremely rare person who has somehow played Diablo 1 2 or 3 and hasn't played Diablo 4, I strongly insist that you go play it.
