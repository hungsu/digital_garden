# ![Return of the Obra Dinn](https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/653530/header.jpg?t=1624548063)

A totally unique mystery videogame, which was given to me on the [[Unsorted/Steam Store\|Steam Store]].

On my first attempt, I gave up after a few scenes. On my second attempt, I created a new [[Digital/Obsidian\|Obsidian]] vault just for this game, and was able to complete it in full without using any cheats or walkthroughs, and felt very satisfied doing so.

If you enjoy [[Concepts/PKM\|Personal Knowledge Management]] and mysteries, I highly recommend this game.
