# Baldur's Gate 3

The game I sunk the most hours into in 2024 and 2025. I've been meaning to write my thoughts on this for a long time, but the game is so enormous, almost anything I write feels like a disservice.

Rather than a full review, I'll describe one highly memorable experience I had within the game:

I came across 3 ogres, including one of particular note: *Lump the Enlightened*. An ogre with a booming voice, who also appeared to be more intelligent than me, in real life.

The ogres greatest passion appeared to be for *meat*. I negotiated with them to aid me in battle, and be allowed to eat those we defeated.

After a battle of defeating many spiders, the ogres expressed that this wasn't enough. The head ogre insisted on licking me to have a taste of something different, which went something like this:

I later discovered that the ogre's intelligence is from a magical crown he swallowed, which I took from his stomach after I killed him!
