# ![Necesse](https://necessewiki.com/mediawiki/images/5/54/Logo_Bare.png)

A 2D multiplayer sandbox game that I've spent many hours playing

I bought it for $6.69USD in 2023 on the [Steam store](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1169040/Necesse/). As of 2025 it is still considered Early Access, but will release 1.0 on 2025-October-15.

Has a dedicated server app for Windows and Linux. I played this game with friends across the US, and running the dedicated server located between us in Chicago made the game much more enjoyable for all. The official docs have a [guide](https://necessewiki.com/Multiplayer-Linux) to running the server app on Linux, but I instead opted to run the server inside a docker container using this [image](https://github.com/BrammyS/necesse-docker-server).
