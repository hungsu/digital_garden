> As of 2023-May-27, Brotato does not have an official website. There is a [Steam store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1942280/Brotato/?snr=1_1056_4_creator_1059&curator_clanid=38515064) and [blog post](https://www.blobfish.dev/my-new-game-brotato/). This means the Google Search results for "brotato" such as `brotato-game.com` are all fake ad-spam.

An [[Private/auto shooter\|auto shooter]] on the [[Private/Steam Store\|Steam Store]] for $4.99USD. Is rated *Overwhelmingly Positive*.

Something I picked up when I noticed my friends racking up 100s of hours in it.

If you have an Android phone, you can download an [APK](https://brotato.wiki.spellsandguns.com/Modding#Mobile_Mods ) of the game, and copy your save file from your computer to your phone to play there, but note that any Achievements you get on your phone won't appear in Steam.

## Stupid mistakes I made

Like most games, in Brotato it's possible to make [[Concepts/easy mistake\|easy mistake]]s. There's a guide to the game on [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-c33h4oZwmWj3ZOz4xp0HN4vIyMXxOwGK8Rm8e4mfKE/edit) which has been useful for me to realise mine, which include

- Buying many bad items, such as Statue, White Flag, Gecko and Riposte. And many others...
- Ignoring game feedback. I observed money fly into a "bag" icon during game but never bothered to inquire what that meant. (It means you'll get that money at the beginning of next round)
- Not knowing how stats work, specifically [Harvesting](https://brotato.wiki.spellsandguns.com/Harvesting). This leads to the next stupid mistake:
- Not buying the best items, like Caffeine, Bag, and Fertilizer.
