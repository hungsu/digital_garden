An underrated FPS.

I bought for just $3.49USD

[This guy](https://youtu.be/f0za4n1siFg) says it is the best FPS campaign he's ever played - recommends for being more adrenaline than even Doom. No filler missions to pad time

One of the characters appears to have a messed up [[Unsorted/Aussie lingo\|Aussie accent]]. He's from [New York](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0851317/bio/?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm).
