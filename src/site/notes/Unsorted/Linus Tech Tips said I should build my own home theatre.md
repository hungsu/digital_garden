# Linus Tech Tips told me to build my own audio, it cost more than I thought

Movie nights at our place were frequently troublesome. Without fail people would say:
- Can we turn on subtitles?
- Can you make it louder? We can't understand what they're saying
- It's too loud, can you turn it back down?

Movie night was never a straightforward *sit down and enjoy the show* experience. I would *always* have to fuss and tinker throughout watching. I was always on alert to manage the volume, and would never be 100% focused on the movie.

This is the sound bar I had. It cost me $110USD including sales tax, and it sucks. Even when I wasn't fussing with the volume, listening to the sound bar felt like plasticky cheap defeat. Sometimes you could hear dialog come out of the pathetic 5-inch "subwoofer" instead of the sound bar. It has 4.2 ⭐ on Amazon and in my opinion it deserves to be around 3.5.

So it felt serendipitous that Linus Tech Tips released the following video: *I Built an INSANE Surround Sound Setup for Under $250*.

A promise of better audio for just a few hundred dollars? Or even just $40 for a noticeable improvement?

Immensely frustrated at how bad our audio situation was, and lured by Linus' reactions at how much improvement they had gained for not too much money, I formulated a basic plan: find second hand speakers and an AV receiver nearby, for up to a few hundred dollars. Surely anything at all would be better than what I had now.

## Preparations, and the first purchase
 ![Facebook Marketplace.jpg](/img/user/Embeds/Facebook%20Marketplace.jpg)
 
 I opened up Facebook marketplace and began browsing. While at the dinner table, my brother-in-law spotted my laptop screen full of speakers, exclaiming loudly:
 
  > "Yes, PLEASE buy some new speakers."
 
Feeling confident that I was on the right path and everything would go well, I began messaging different sellers. One listing of interest to me was a 7.1 Onkyo set-up for $100 including cables - the same price as my sound bar. As long as it all worked I thought it should surely be far better than the sound bar, and in theory I would have everything I need to start without having to buy cables.

The seller explained he wasn't in the country but we could pick up the speakers being held by his housemate. Before handing over money, I plugged in the receiver to a wall socket to confirm it at least turned on, which it did. Things seemed well enough, so I paid for these and brought it all home.

Once at home, I unplugged my sound bar and eagerly set everything up. I turned it on...**no sound played at all**. Volume dial all the way up and not a peep. I did have a spare 2.0 amplifier that I connected to the speakers, and the speakers worked, confirming the Onkyo receiver was a huge, dead, brick. Some quick googling revealed [others with the same problem](https://www.hometheaterforum.com/community/threads/onkyo-ht-r590-no-sound-output-question-regarding-7-1-or-7-2.380775/). Additionally, on closer inspection, the seller had given me an RCA cable that could not possibly work with the subwoofer, having a white plastic tip on the end. It would appear this setup could not possibly have ever worked.

Of course, the seller rejected my request for a refund.

I was down $100, with a pile of useless speakers, a dead receiver, and an unimpressed wife.


## A second purchase, a $20 receiver

As luck might have it, I saw a listing for a Yamaha receiver for only $20. Eager to fix my pile of dead bricks, I rushed over. The seller had already boxed the receiver, but was gracious enough to unbox it and connect it to his speakers to prove it worked. It sounded clean and perfectly loud enough so I was extremely pleased to have what seemed to be such a good deal, and eagerly brought it home. All seemed well!

With just 2 front speakers and a centre, I had some unique experiences that I don't think I've had before:
- In [[TV/Devil May Cry (2025)\|Devil May Cry]], a tentacle moved across the screen, making squishy wet sounds as it moved. I could hear the sound seemingly coming from the tentacle!
- While watching Last of Us season 2, a character called out from another room asking if Pedro Pascal wanted a drink. I thought someone was in my house calling from the other room!

## Doing research, and the third purchase to audio glory

NHT
## catastrophic failure

But, concerns began to build. I connected the receiver to the subwoofer and could get almost no sound all. 

speakers no bass

And things got worse.
But...it didn't last. While watching things, the receiver would seem to cut out audio entirely. Infrequently enough to ignore at first, but eventually the receiver seemed to sputter and die every few seconds for multiple seconds, rendering audio entirely useless. I tried a variety of fixes: moving the receiver to a UPS, using expensive copper speaker cable, disabled HDMI ARC, but none seemed to fix the problem. I began to wonder if I was cursed.
Degradation
Audio cut outs

ruined movie unwatchable

## Negotiating the end game

Determined to be able to enjoy my center properly, I went hunting for a new receiver. For the first time I tried negotiating - a listing that was a few weeks old and had already dropped in price once, from $100 to $80. I offered $50, and seconds later the seller accepted.


## A complete cost breakdown of doing things this way

There are a lot of costs associated with putting together your own speaker system with second hand parts primarily *time*, *space*, and *unexpected failures*.

Time spent:
- researching speaker and receiver technology in general - but this was kind of fun and interesting for me
- browsing nearby listings, figuring out if they might be worthwhile
- messaging and negotiating with different sellers
- driving to pick up stuff
- fussing with different combinations of cables
- troubleshooting defective devices

Space is a huge cost I didn't think about. The speakers and receiver and subwoofer alone take up quite a lot of space. In addition, I have a lot of leftover junk and parts from the ordeal consuming space in my garage:
- Defective Onkyo receiver
- Onkyo center channel
- Onkyo surrounds
- Defective Onkyo subwoofer
- Defective Yamaha receiver
- Way more speaker wire than I'll ever need

Then there's the actual money cost. Something Linus did not mention was the cost of buying wire and cables. It's not much, but at these price ranges, new speaker wire is a non-trivial fraction of the budget, broken down below:

| Cost    | Item                                  |
| ------- | ------------------------------------- |
| $100    | Onkyo 7.1 system                      |
| $11     | RCA cable                             |
| $20     | Yamaha receiver                       |
| $80     | NHT monitor                           |
| $80     | NHT subwoofer                         |
| $7.59   | Right angle power cable for subwoofer |
| $26.51  | Pure copper speaker cable (100 feet)  |
| $50     | Denon receiver                        |
| $375.10 | Total                                 |
