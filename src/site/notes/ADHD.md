# ADHD

Short for *attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder*. A neurodivergence characterised by some differences in brain anatomy and structure:

- Lower levels of dopamine

## Treating ADHD

ADHD is permanent and any treatment for its symptoms has 100% regression rate. That said, the negative side effects of ADHD can be handled in a variety of ways.

### Environment changes and tools 

It has been said that [[Claims/All failure is systems failure\|All failure is systems failure]]. It is helpful to adopt this mindset in treating ADHD, as those with it tend to blame themselves for all their troubles, leading to a negative feedback loop. Additionally, changing one's environment is non-invasive and highly affordable compared to other treatments. Here are some environmental changes that have helped me.

#### Control the noise with brown noise and wireless earphones

I have found that I become distracted by noise around me - typically nearby conversations when I'm in the office, or barking dogs at home and nearby phone calls when at home.

Attempting to fix this by  listening to music results in me being significantly less productive, as I find myself distracted by Liking music tracks, fussing with playlists, skipping to next track when the current track becomes slightly too uninteresting.

Attempting again to fix this by using [[Noise cancellation\|noise cancelling]] headphones causes me to be distracted by the sounds of my own body - I'm suddenly able to hear my own heartbeat, very small movements, even [[Private/headphone cable noise\|headphone cable noise]] if I'm using wired headphones. 

Many with ADHD have [reported](https://twitter.com/hiangelali/status/1574328682751356928) being able to be more productive in the dull roar of air travel[^1], and I've also found this to be true. A researcher, [[Private/Goran Suderland\|Göran Söderlund]], has done 15 studies of white noise on people with ADHD and has found people with ADHD perform better on memory and language tasks. Söderlund theorizes that in people with ADHD, listening to broadband noise somehow causes the brain to mimic the effects of dopamine.[^2] It is too expensive to book a plane ticket every time you need to be productive, but using a [[Private/white noise\|brown noise]]  app is free. [Mynoise.net](https://mynoise.net/) is a free web app to generate noise, with a section specifically for ADHD. I've found the [B-17 flying fortress](https://mynoise.net/NoiseMachines/propellerNoiseGenerator.php) preset to suit me well.

As for wireless earphones and headphones, I am using [[Gear/Samsung Buds 2\|Samsung Buds 2]] and [[Gear/Sony WH-1000XM3\|Sony WH-1000XM3]].

#### Write your thoughts in an outliner

Write in an [[outlining app\|outlining app]]. The act of writing in the app can act as a kind of *stimming*, and the resulting writing can be used later.

### Therapy and coaching

With ADHD being a neurodivergence, the vast majority of gains in treating it will likely be in the form of behavioural change. These take more time, focus, and possibly money, so you may want to consider these once you've exhausted your options in Environmental changes.
