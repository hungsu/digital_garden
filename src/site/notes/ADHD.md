# ADHD

Short for *attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder*. At a glance, a person with ADHD may appear to others as childish and should just "grow up" and do their duties. The person with ADHD may try very hard to do so, but instead finds themselves unable to operate as others expect. 

## What is it like to have  ADHD?

ADHD can be Inattentive, Hyperactive-impulsive, or Combined. This can be read up in more accurate detail on a more reliable source such as the [CDC page](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/adhd/facts.html). ADHD is a serious condition and you shouldn't rely wholy on social media sources for this.

That said, I realised I both had ADHD and that ADHD was causing me trouble when I learned about *ADHD procrastination*.

### ADHD and procrastination

[[Concepts/procrastination\|procrastination]] is common for all people. Where people with ADHD differ is they suffer from [[Concepts/ADHD procrastination\|ADHD procrastination]]. Lazy procrastination spends no attention on the task, while ADHD procrastination expends massive amounts of attention on the task while failing.

For example, common procrastination might be a student playing videogames instead of doing homework. They are not devoting even a single thought to the homework as they procrastinate.

By contrast, if I choose to play videogames instead of my task, I will be thinking about the task as I play. I will reject offers to spend time with others, because I know I should do this task. I will even get annoyed at people inviting me to do such things - an example of *emotional dysregulation* discussed later. I am not avoiding the task in the classic sense - I am expending immense mental effort trying to set myself up to do and succeed at the task. I will sit at the computer, programs open, everything ready, to work, entire days like this, but nothing is done. I want to do the task, I understand the Importance of the task, but cannot do it. This is ADHD procrastination.

## Treating ADHD

ADHD is permanent, and while treatment for its negative aspects can be effective, there is 100% regression rate on symptoms - they are part of your character. That said, the negative side effects of ADHD can be handled in a variety of ways.
