# ADHD

Short for *attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder*. At a glance, a person with ADHD may appear to others as childish and should just "grow up" and do their duties. The person with ADHD may try very hard to do so, but instead finds themselves unable to operate as others expect. 

## What is it like to have  ADHD?

ADHD can be Inattentive, Hyperactive-impulsive, or Combined. This can be read up in more accurate detail on a more reliable source such as the [CDC page](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/adhd/facts.html). ADHD is a serious condition and you shouldn't rely wholy on social media sources for this.

That said, I realised I both had ADHD and that ADHD was causing me trouble when I learned about *ADHD procrastination*.

### ADHD and procrastination

[[Public/Procrastination\|Procrastination]] is common for all people. Where people with ADHD differ is they suffer from [[Concepts/ADHD procrastination\|ADHD procrastination]]. Lazy procrastination spends no attention on the task, while ADHD procrastination expends massive amounts of attention on the task while failing.

For example, common procrastination might be a student playing videogames instead of doing homework. They are not devoting even a single thought to the homework as they procrastinate.

By contrast, if I choose to play videogames instead of my task, I will be thinking about the task as I play. I will reject offers to spend time with others, because I know I should do this task. I will even get annoyed at people inviting me to do such things - an example of *emotional dysregulation* discussed later. I am not avoiding the task in the classic sense - I am expending immense mental effort trying to set myself up to do and succeed at the task. I will sit at the computer, programs open, everything ready, to work, entire days like this, but nothing is done. I want to do the task, I understand the Importance of the task, but cannot do it. This is ADHD procrastination.

## Treating ADHD

ADHD is permanent, and while treatment for its negative aspects can be effective, there is 100% regression rate on symptoms - they are part of your character. That said, the negative side effects of ADHD can be handled in a variety of ways.

### Environment changes and tools 

It has been said that [[Claims/All failure is systems failure\|All failure is systems failure]]. It is helpful to adopt this mindset in treating ADHD, as those with it tend to blame themselves for all their troubles, leading to a negative feedback loop. Additionally, changing one's environment is non-invasive and highly affordable compared to other treatments. Here are some environmental changes that have helped me.

#### Control the noise with brown noise and wireless earphones

I have found that I become distracted by noise around me - typically nearby conversations when I'm in the office, or barking dogs and nearby phone calls when at home.

Attempting to fix this by  listening to music results in me being significantly less productive, as I find myself distracted by Liking music tracks, fussing with playlists, skipping to next track when the current track becomes slightly too uninteresting.

Attempting again to fix this by using [[Noise cancellation\|noise cancelling]] headphones causes me to be distracted by the sounds of my own body - I'm suddenly able to hear my own heartbeat, very small movements, even [[Private/headphone cable noise\|headphone cable noise]] if I'm using wired headphones. 

Many with ADHD have [reported](https://twitter.com/hiangelali/status/1574328682751356928) being able to be more productive in the dull roar of air travel[^1], and I've also found this to be true. A researcher, [[Private/Goran Suderland\|Göran Söderlund]], has done 15 studies of white noise on people with ADHD and has found people with ADHD perform better on memory and language tasks. Söderlund theorizes that in people with ADHD, listening to broadband noise somehow causes the brain to mimic the effects of dopamine.[^2] It is too expensive to book a plane ticket every time you need to be productive, but using a [[Private/white noise\|brown noise]]  app is free. [Mynoise.net](https://mynoise.net/) is a free web app to generate noise, with a section specifically for ADHD. I've found the [B-17 flying fortress](https://mynoise.net/NoiseMachines/propellerNoiseGenerator.php) preset to suit me well, and is the example you see above.

As for wireless earphones and headphones, I am using [[Gear/Samsung Buds 2\|Samsung Buds 2]] and [[Gear/Sony WH-1000XM3\|Sony WH-1000XM3]].

#### Write your thoughts in a journal

ADHDers have many thoughts that can feel like they have nowhere to go. By writing them down, they are given a chance to become something more useful.

Additionally, if you use an app for your journal, the act of typing into the app can act as a kind of *stimming*, particularly on a [[Private/Mechanical keyboard\|Mechanical keyboard]]. The resulting writing can be used for reflection, documentation, task management and many other things.

#### Use an outliner for your journal

[[outlining app\|Outliners]] are distinct from note taking apps by treating all writing as Bullet Points that can be infinitely nested. This suits ADHDers in a number of ways:

Outlines are highly rearrangeable. Unlike conventional Documents in word processing applications like Google Docs and Evernote and Obsidian, Outliners expect you to rearrange and reorganise your writing heavily. An outliner's bullet points can be clicked and dragged and rearranged much more easily. This suits ADHDers whose thoughts are chaotic and go into many tangents.

Outlines are focusable. On writing a chaotic chain of thought, an outliner allows the user to choose any bullet point to focus on, hiding all others.

I recommend [[Private/Logseq\|Logseq]] as a privacy focused and free outliner. In the past I have used [[Private/Workflowy\|Workflowy]] and [[Private/Dynalist\|Dynalist]], but I feel Logseq is easily superior. [[Private/Tana Inc\|Tana Inc]] is another outliner that is highly acclaimed, but not privacy focused.

### Therapy and coaching

With ADHD being a neurodivergence, the vast majority of gains in treating it will likely be in the form of behavioural change. These take more time, focus, and possibly money, so you may want to consider these once you've exhausted your options in Environmental changes.

#### Reset your dopamine with a digital detox

With access to many sources of easy dopamine, such as social media and infinite scrolling feeds, one's baseline dopamine may rise, thus meaning you need more dopamine to reach the same baseline. You might experience this as enjoyable things no longer being enjoyable. A [digital detox](https://psyche.co/ideas/the-pleasure-the-pain-and-the-politics-of-a-digital-detox?utm_source=rss-feed) can lower this baseline, so that those activities become enjoyable again. One should expect such a detox to require at least *two weeks*.
