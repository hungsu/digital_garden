# Hoarding knowledge gives the illusion of knowledge

> [!quote] Arthur Schopenhauer
> A constant flow of thoughts expressed by other people can stop and deaden your own thought and your own initiative.

People are frequently inclined to acquire more books, videos, articles and more than they can ever consume. The possession of these things gives the user the illusion of having already learned, without learning anything. This illusion can be so convincing it can fool others as well as yourself.

## Knowledge hoarding can take many forms

What is most insidious about knowledge hoarding is that doing it feels productive. There are many examples:

Collecting bookmarks to interesting articles and videos gives you a growing pile of the "work" you did. In some apps, that pile might be beautifully styled or even have automatic AI summaries.

Acquiring, arranging and shelving books looks beautiful and impressive. The more books, the more impressive.

Highlighting/underlining of text in books gives us a pile of supposedly curated high-density information:

Digital tools such as Evernote web clipper allow the easy, instant saving of whole articles to an archive to live forever.

And there are many more examples of hoarding information.

## The illusion of knowledge is strong, until it isn't

One may feel that having all of the above puts you at an advantage. And to a small extent, it does. But in all of the above examples, even the mildest of tests of knowledge will result in failure.  
This is embarrassing for all concerned.

- When someone sees your collection of books, and asks what you thought of one, you will be confronted with the embarrassing situation of not being able to answer. Worse, someone may ask if you have such a book, and you may not even realise you own it.
- ==Highlighting ebooks in Kindle mostly results in a #fill-in-the-blank ==

## There are bad and good solutions to hoarding

If you have found you are acquiring more than you can consume, one might consider which action to take next. There are some bad options.

- One might be tempted to consume the media as mindlessly as possible, by [[Private/doomscrolling\|doomscrolling]]. This is a bad idea #fill-in-the-blank 
- If it is non-fiction, one may be tempted to skim it, or speed read it. But beware, [[Private/Reading without note taking is time wasting\|Reading without note taking is time wasting]].
- If it is an e-book, one may be tempted to skim it while highlighting important phrases. This is also a bad idea, for the collected highlights will become an unintelligible hoard of their own.

These all fail because they do not address the underlying concern: for you to know a thing, new neurons must form in your brain. Forming these is a difficult process that requires effort.

- You can share the media with your friends - beware of oversharing #fill-in-the-blank  meme of friend sharing too many links
- For notable media you can make events out of consuming these, such as a book club or games club.
- 
- By far the best is to create your own knowledge and media. The [generation effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_effect) is a known phenomenon where information is better remembered when generated from your own mind, rather than only consumed from someone else.
	- For simple forms of knowledge, you might want to create flash cards. This is well suited to simple information, such as translations of words.
	- If you are hoarding books and articles, you can begin by paraphrasing what you understand. write your own notes and essays on the topic (particularly the [[Private/Feynman Learning Technique\|Feynman Learning Technique]]), and [[Claims/You should link your notes\|linking your notes]].

## Information overload is similar but different

[[Concepts/Information overload\|Information overload]] differs from information hoarding, in that overload can be caused by others as well as yourself. Information hoarding is purely self-inflicted.
