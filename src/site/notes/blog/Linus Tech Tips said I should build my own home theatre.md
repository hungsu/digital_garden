# Linus Tech Tips said I should build my own home theatre
<p style="text-align:center">So I did. It cost more than I thought.</p>

Movie nights at our place were frequently troublesome. Without fail people would say:
- Can we turn on subtitles?
- Can you make it louder? We can't understand what they're saying
- It's too loud, can you turn it back down?

Movie night was never a straightforward *sit down and enjoy the show* experience. I would *always* have to fuss and tinker throughout watching. I was always on alert to manage the volume, and would never be 100% focused on the movie.

This is the sound bar I had. It cost me $110USD including sales tax, and it sucks. Even when I wasn't fussing with the volume, listening to the sound bar felt like plasticky cheap defeat. Sometimes you could hear dialog come out of the pathetic 5-inch "subwoofer" instead of the sound bar. It has 4.2 ⭐ on Amazon and in my opinion it deserves to be around 3 ⭐.

So it felt serendipitous that Linus Tech Tips released the following video: *I Built an INSANE Surround Sound Setup for Under $250*.

A promise of better audio for just a few hundred dollars? Or even just $40 for a noticeable improvement? I formulated a basic plan: find second hand speakers and an AV receiver nearby, for up to a few hundred dollars. Surely anything at all would be better than what I had now.

 I opened up Facebook marketplace and began browsing. My brother-in-law spotted my laptop screen full of speakers, exclaiming loudly:
 
  > "Yes, PLEASE buy some new speakers."

## Second hand means a chance of failure, and no returns

In Linus' video, every speaker and part he bought seems to work. For me, over the course of my three week audio journey I bought *three* defective items:

- a subwoofer that was too quiet to practically use
- a receiver that turned on but didn't make any sound
- a receiver that worked great at first but failed soon after

These kinds of failures are difficult or impossible to detect when buying. And 95% or more of the time, buyers won't refund you for defective items. 

Then there's the wasted time. Many many hours were wasted on:
- communicating with the sellers of these devices about the initial purchase
- driving to pick up stuff
- diagnosing and attempting to fix these devices
- attempting to negotiate refunds, and failing
- looking for replacements
- disposing of dead equipment - I went to a nearby electronics recycling event

3 out of 12 items I bought were failures - a 25% failure rate is shockingly high and a legitimate reason for people to not want to deal with second hand goods. 


### Second hand audio costs less than new, but more than you'd think

Then there's the wasted money - the above is around $100 of gear that didn't work out for me. Also, Linus did not mention was the cost of buying wire and cables. It's not much, but at these price ranges, new speaker wire is a non-trivial fraction of the budget. My spending is broken down below:

| Cost    | Item                                  |
| ------- | ------------------------------------- |
| $100    | Onkyo 7.1 system                      |
| $11     | RCA cable                             |
| $20     | Yamaha receiver                       |
| $80     | NHT monitor                           |
| $80     | NHT subwoofer                         |
| $7.59   | Right angle power cable for subwoofer |
| $26.51  | Pure copper speaker cable (100 feet)  |
| $50     | Denon receiver                        |
| $375.10 | Total                                 |

Of all this, $146.51 was essentially waste. That said, at $375.10, I'm still much happier with my final setup than an off-the-shelf soundbar - it just wasn't as cheap as I thought it would be.


### Home theatres take a lot of space

Space is a huge cost I didn't think about. The speakers and receiver and subwoofer alone take up quite a lot of space. In addition, I have a lot of leftover junk and parts from the ordeal consuming space in my garage:
- Defective Onkyo receiver
- Onkyo center channel
- Onkyo surrounds
- Defective Onkyo subwoofer
- Defective Yamaha receiver
- Way more speaker wire than I'll ever need

## Fast forward to the end result - they sound great

With just 2 front speakers and a centre, I had some unique experiences that I don't think I've had before:
- In [[TV/Devil May Cry (2025)\|Devil May Cry]], a tentacle moved across the screen, making squishy wet sounds as it moved. I could hear the sound seemingly coming from the tentacle!
- While watching Last of Us season 2, a character called out from another room asking if Pedro Pascal wanted a drink. I thought someone was in my house calling from the other room!

## If you watch movies with a crappy sound bar, you should probably do this too


Some of the time spent on this project was enjoyable. I liked reading about [[Unsorted/center channel speaker\|center channel speaker]]s, response curves, and browsing reddit arguments I'd never participate in. And daily browsing of nearby classifieds was certainly better than doomscrolling US political news.
