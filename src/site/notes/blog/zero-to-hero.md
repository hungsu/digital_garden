# Mastery, and my pursuit of it


> I have a suspicion that most adults (75%+) could pick any skill—excluding sports—and work their way into the top 10% in the world simply by working exclusively on it every day for two years. But almost nobody displays that degree of focus, so we will never know.

It is the 16th of January, 2023 as I write this, and I work in a company with around 250 other UI software engineers. I don't understand problems or discussions the engineers have, other engineers don't seek my counsel, I make code submissions slowly, my submissions are bombarded with suggestions for improvement, and more. If there were a ranking of all the engineers, as determined by those engineers, I suspect I'd be somewhere near the bottom.

You reading this are probably very smart, and enjoy the feeling of people coming to you for advice, and seeing their faces light up as you solve their problems. Or perhaps not. By contrast, feeling like a useless idiot is *crushing*. On more than one occasion I've wanted to quit and disappear into the mountains. This isn't impostor syndrome - the feeling of being an idiot when in fact one's skill is great. I genuinely have little to offer, and I don't want to stay this way.

I've been thinking constantly for weeks about the idea of becoming a master in some domain. Particularly if that domain is highly subjective, barely defined, and non-measurable, like software engineering. Contrast this with [[Private/becoming top percentile\|becoming top percentile]], where the skill is highly measurable, usually in the form of a single scoreboard that is known to all participants.

Something about feeling like a complete loser is filling me with an enormous urge to climb to the top.

## Measuring the unmeasurable

A common trait of people who fail to improve are vague statements and a lack of objectivity about their current situation. I think I can do better.

I can feel myself being at "the bottom" in a number of ways I can define and measure:

- **Comprehension**. Low or no comprehension in text and verbal discussions. Other engineers I see discussing hard problems - I barely understand the problems, and certainly not the solutions they're debating. To improve, I'm going to try accumulating *[[Private/Evergreen note\|Evergreen note]]s about UI engineering* that I've written myself, which for now is *one*: I have one excellent note about virtual machines, but I will need many more.
- **Helpfulness**. Other engineers get stuck every day. I rarely have thoughts to offer, and when I do, such thoughts are not accepted or do not resolve the problem. Thus I find myself avoiding offers to pair program because I fear I'll drag the other person down. The obvious metric is *Problems solved*, which for now I believe is *zero*.
- **Creation speed**. I create *slowly* and at a quality that others do not approve, with a great volume of suggestions from reviewers. I will measure this in *PRs merged per month*. At time of writing, I am at around 1.16 PRs merged per month. By contrast, one of the most beloved engineers on the team is at 5.5 PRs merged per month. Another merged 14 PRs in the last month. I'm feeling pretty upset just typing this and seeing the gap, but it's important for me to see how big the gap is.

## Plan, then execute

My most precious resource is *time*. With other engineers already so far ahead, I can't afford to waste time on things that don't help.

plan to improve them, and do the work to practice.

## Getting feedback, and a coach

> Professional athletes use coaches to make sure they are as good as they can be. But doctors don’t. I’d paid to have a kid just out of college look at my serve. So why did I find it inconceivable to pay someone to come into my operating room and coach me on my surgical technique?

## Plateaus, Slumps and Ruts

One will eventually find that your performance is rising slowly, stagnating, or even falling. 

A rut is a state of skill stagnation, where despite a great deal of time spent using the skill, no increase in skill can be observed. Ruts are common after *Unconscious Competence* level of proficiency has been achieved. 

This is common and expected, thankfully there are some known causes and remedies

### Test against a variety of environments

- Management consultants who work for a wide range of clients are more likely to learn broad principles than those who work only with a single firm or industry.[^1]
- Psychologist Gary Klein [reports](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0262532816/ref=ox_sc_saved_title_9?smid=A3DWYIK6Y9EEQB&psc=1) that inner-city firefighters progress much faster than rural firefighters, owing to the more varied firefighting conditions.

Repetition with variablity 

**A losing streak** - this tends to result in doing the same behaviour over and over

### Work with a variety of teachers, peers

Having a variety of peers exposes you to different strategies and is less likely to get you in a rut.

Learning a language, benefits from [exposure to different speakers](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2013-18820-001), accents and speaking styles. Learning from several teachers is more likely to promote diverse perspectives.

### Know what to do, can't do it

Skyline thinks usually one of these:

- Lack of preparation - Easiest one to fix
- Lack of confidence - Particularly if one has been a low performer for a very long time. Best trick is hype - hype yourself (but do not lie to yourself) - tell the truth about all the things you have done to make yourself better. Hype causes a temporary confidence boost which should be enough to get a win
- Lack of experience

### Having no goal
