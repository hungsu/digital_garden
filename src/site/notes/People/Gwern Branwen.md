# Gwern Branwen

One of my favourite writers, with one of [[My favourite blogs\|my favourite blogs]]: [Gwern.net](https://gwern.net/index). I find his writing impeccably interesting and reliable. I discovered him by accident in 2013, having saved his [article](http://www.gwern.net/Spaced%20repetition?utm_source=pocket_mylist) on [[Unsorted/spaced repetition\|spaced repetition]] in my [[Unsorted/Pocket\|Pocket]] account.

## My favourite blog posts

In a [few paragraphs](https://gwern.net/design-graveyard#google-web-fonts) he details his experience and criticism of [[Unsorted/Google Fonts\|Google Fonts]], all of which I agree with.

I find his colour sense and typographical taste a little ghastly, but also fascinating to read about his reasoning, which he documented very thoroughly in [Design Of This Website](https://gwern.net/design).

My favourite post is the one about [[Unsorted/Death Note\|Death Note]]: [L, Anonymity & Eluding Entropy](https://gwern.net/death-note-anonymity). But I also enjoy his blog post about [[Books/Dune by Frank Herbert\|Dune]]: [Dune notes](https://www.gwern.net/dune)

He experimented with an [[Gear/under desk treadmill\|under desk treadmill]] for a few months and [wrote a lot](https://gwern.net/treadmill).

He has extensive thoughts about [[Concepts/PKM\|PKM]] in his listicle, [Information Organizing](https://gwern.net/about#information-organizing)

## Other things

He also has a [Github](https://github.com/gwern) with the source code of his blog, in PHP.

He also posts over on [[Unsorted/Less Wrong\|Less Wrong]] as [himself](https://www.lesswrong.com/users/gwern?from=post_header), and [[Unsorted/Hacker News\|Hacker News]] as [himself](https://news.ycombinator.com/threads?id=gwern).
