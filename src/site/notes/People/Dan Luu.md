# Dan Luu

One of my favourite writers on [[Private/Software engineering\|software engineering]] and other computery things. Much of his work on his [blog](https://danluu.com/), but his more recent work is behind his [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/danluu), because he wants to write full time without going to [[Seeds/Substack\|Substack]]. His patreon subscription cost is high at $24USD/month, so I'm yet to subscribe.
