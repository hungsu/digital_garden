# Paper WM

A [[Concepts/scrollable tiling window manager\|scrollable tiling window manager]] layer on top of [[Digital/GNOME\|GNOME]]. Every app you open takes the full height of your screen, and is placed in a single row without overlapping any other apps. If your screen runs out of room, apps go off the edge of the screen, and can still be reached by scrolling or with keyboard shortcuts.

This is my number one favourite reason to use [[Unsorted/Linux\|Linux]]. It's so satisfying to use that I tend to avoid using tabs, and open things in new windows instead.

When I moved back to Windows 10/11, I made [[Digital/Winfinity\|Winfinity]] to attempt to emulate its behaviour.

PaperWM is written using [[Unsorted/JavaScript\|JavaScript]]. Its open source and has a [GitHub](https://github.com/paperwm/PaperWM).

[[Julia Evans\|Julia Evans]] wrote a [piece](https://jvns.ca/blog/2020/01/05/paperwm/) in 2020: "I’ve been using PaperWM for 6 months on a laptop and I really like it! I also really appreciate that even though it’s configurable (by writing a Javascript configuration file), it does the things I want out of the box without me having to research how to configure it."

[[Unsorted/CardboardWM\|CardboardWM]] and EndlessWM are similar
