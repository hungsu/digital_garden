A framework designed to build websites with excellent [[Unsorted/First Input delay\|First Input delay]].

[Official website](https://qwik.dev/)
[Github](https://github.com/BuilderIO/qwik) 

Made by creator of [[Digital/AngularJS\|AngularJS]], [[Misko Hevery\|Misko Hevery]]. [[Unsorted/Jason Lengstorf\|Learn with Jason]] hosted Misko for a [video](https://youtu.be/_PDpoJUacuc) to make a quick app with it.

Uses [[Unsorted/JSX\|JSX]] for templating.

Front End Masters has a [3h48m course](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/qwik/) on it 

## Adoption and sentiment of Qwik is not great

In 2023, [[Unsorted/Technology Radar\|Technology Radar]] recommended *assessing* Qwik:
> One of the challenges of creating a rich, interactive browser-based experience is in minimizing the time from first request to full user interactivity. When starting up, the application may need to download large amounts of JavaScript to the browser or execute a lengthy process to restore application state on the server. **[Qwik](https://qwik.builder.io/)** is a new front-end framework that serializes application state so it can be rendered on the server without rehydrating and replaying application logic. This is achieved through _resumability_, which involves pausing execution on the server to resume it on the client. Like other newer front-end frameworks, such as [Astro](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/languages-and-frameworks/astro) or [Svelte](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/languages-and-frameworks/svelte), Qwik also speeds up initial page load times by minimizing the amount of JavaScript to load. In Qwik's case, the initial application download is primarily HTML, with most JavaScript loaded dynamically on demand from a local cache, if possible.

But in [2024](https://2024.stateofjs.com/en-US/libraries/), State of JS shows a decline in Qwik adoption.

I likely will not be trying it out for any of my own projects.
