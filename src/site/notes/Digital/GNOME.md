# GNOME

A [[linux desktop environment\|linux desktop environment]] that seems to gather strong opinions.

Comes by default on Ubuntu, and was what I used in my experiment, [[blog/My experience with Ubuntu in 2020\|My experience with Ubuntu in 2020]].

[Some say](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30750710 ) GNOME is amazing. I use it only because it is required to use [[Digital/PaperWM\|PaperWM]].

Factorio devs *klonan* and *raiguard* in [2024 said its dumb](https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-408):
