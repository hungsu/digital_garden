# Agatha Christie's Poirot (1989)

[IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094525/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_4_nm_4_in_0_q_poirot) 8.6 ⭐

A whodunnit TV series that ran for 24 years!

[David Suchet](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0837064/?ref_=tt_ov_1_1) plays as [[People/Hercule Poirot\|Hercule Poirot]], and is our favourite version of Poirot. Even better than Kenneth Branagh!

The Prime Video version is the worst version to watch. Subtitles omit Poirot's French dialog with lazy text `(speaks French)`, and S2E1 is sliced up in nonsensical way.

The best version is blu-ray. It maintains the original's 4:3 aspect ratio and the subtitles include Poirot's many French exclamations. *Précisément*!
