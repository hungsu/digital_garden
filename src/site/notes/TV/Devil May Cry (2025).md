A TV series based on the [[Devil May Cry\|Devil May Cry]] games. Very strongly tailored to that audience - people who were edgy emo teens in the 2000s listening to Evanescence and Linken Park, who have grown into working class adults in 2025. The show displays some self awareness of how much we cringe at our edgy teenage years, while respecting it.

Episode 6 is magnificent and could also be watched standalone. If you start watching this series and feel yourself wanting to quit, I strongly recommend watching Episode 6 before you quit.
