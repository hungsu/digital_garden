# Time blocking

> it makes you twice as productive as those suckers who rely on lists.
> â€”[[Private/Cal Newport\|Cal Newport]]

A time management and task management method that assigns periods of time to work on tasks. 

## The method

1. Open your planner. A calendar app can work, but paper is preferable so that you are not exposed to notifications or other distractions such as your email and Slack.
2. Draw blocks for pre-existing commitments. A block has a start time, end time, and what it's for.
3. Draw blocks for the things you want to work on
4. Commit to the blocks you have drawn. Consider using a Tomato Timer or [[Gear/Time timer\|Time timer]].
5. If interruptions or delays occur, redraw your blocks. Another reason why paper is advantageous is that you can see these corrections. A digital calendar will not.
6. At the end of the day, review tasks you didn't finish, and new tasks that came in.[^1] Consider doing this as part of a larger [[Private/end of work day ritual\|end of work day ritual]].

## Why?

Scheduling can be a prison, but can also be a defensive wall against external thieves of your time.
