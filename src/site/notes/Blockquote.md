# Blockquote

A long phrase or quotation that is embellished or highlighted as being especially important. They can function as an opportunity to show some [[typography\|typographic]] flair.

## Pretty examples

![smashing_magazine_blockquote.jpg](/img/user/Embeds/smashing_magazine_blockquote.jpg)

Smashing Magazine has an enormous embellished quotation mark, and a cute rounded geometric sans font.

![Quanta_blockquote.png](/img/user/Embeds/Quanta_blockquote.png)

Quanta Magazine has blockquotes framed with ornamental quotation marks.

[[Private/Undark\|Undark]] has blockquotes with a thick and solid left bar, a bigger font size, italics, and a different colour.

![The_Verge_blockquote.png](/img/user/Embeds/The_Verge_blockquote.png)

The Verge floats to the side, with lines reminiscent of a ruled school notebook.

I find the Verge's old blockquote design with all caps, pink italics to be garish.


![Bustle blockquote.jpg](/img/user/Vaults/quartz/content/notes/images/Bustle%20blockquote.jpg)

[Bustle](https://www.bustle.com/wellness/overcoming-burnout-self-care?ref=refind) has very pretty blockquotes. Note the reduced letter-spacing (Kerning):

![](/img/user/Vaults/quartz/content/notes/images/Polygon_side_quote.jpg)

[Polygon](https://www.polygon.com/23025632/metaverse-mmo-ending) has a curious sidenote-like blockquote, with all caps, italics, and a vertical gradient:

![Maggie Appleton blockquote.png](/img/user/Vaults/quartz/content/notes/images/Maggie%20Appleton%20blockquote.png)

[[People/Maggie Appleton\|Maggie Appleton]] has some beautiful blockquotes on her notes. Centre aligned, with small decorative bars above and below:

![Wired magazine blockquote.png](/img/user/Vaults/quartz/content/notes/images/Wired%20magazine%20blockquote.png)

[[Private/Wired magazine\|Wired magazine]] has quotes with a thick left bar, and generous white space all around.

![McKinsey blockquote.jpg](/img/user/Vaults/quartz/content/notes/images/McKinsey%20blockquote.jpg)

McKinsey has quotes that break outside of the document width:

[Hidden Heroes](https://hiddenheroes.netguru.com/douglas-engelbart) quotes also break out of width, with a bold sans caps font and a subtle purple, topped off with a little flag like a cherry-on-top.

![](/img/user/Vaults/quartz/content/notes/images/thecut_blockquote.jpg)

[The Cut](https://www.thecut.com/article/meghan-markle-profile-interview.html) has some very loud blockquotes, off to one side, in caps, with wider letter spacing, plenty of white space all around, and with a thick bar on top for good measure.

![](/img/user/Vaults/quartz/content/notes/images/farnamstreet_blockquote.jpg)

[Farnam Street](https://fs.blog/munger-worldly-wisdom/?ref=refind) features a handsome bold geometric sans font for the blockquote itself and a smaller text size on the last line.

## How to implement

I like to type a quotation dash `—` using the Windows Emoji keyboard, by pressing `Win` + `.`, then going to the Symbols tab.

## People against Blockquotes

[[Private/Practical Typography\|Practical Typography]] seems to dislike them. From their page on [Block quotations](https://practicaltypography.com/block-quotations.html):

> The reader’s next thought is usually “Great—I can skip this.” So if you want readers to pay attention to quoted material, edit it carefully and integrate it into the text. Don’t just shovel it into a block quotation.
