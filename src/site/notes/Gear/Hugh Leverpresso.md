# Hugh Leverpresso

A [[Unsorted/manual espresso machine\|manual espresso machine]], using two levers to create the requisite 9 bars of pressure. 

Something about the process of using this helps me wake up in the morning, and I think it's more effective than the actual caffeine from the coffee. It isn't possible to cheat: any failure in paying attention, will mean I don't get my coffee. Something about applying a great deal of physical force on an object for 30 seconds really wakes me up.

It has only a few downsides:
- it can only make double shots of espresso, and I generally have single shots. 
- It takes more overall time than using an electric machine, but much less time than other mechanical espresso machines I've tried, such as the *Flair Neo*.

Other than that, this item is basically perfect, and at only around $105USD, far better value than many other espresso machines.
