# NHT V Woofer

![20250820 NHT Verve subwoofer.jpg](/img/user/20250820%20NHT%20Verve%20subwoofer.jpg)

A [[Unsorted/subwoofer\|subwoofer]] I bought from FB Marketplace. I wasn't expecting to buy it - I was meeting the seller for the [[Gear/NHT M5 monitor\|NHT M5 monitor]], who offered me this while I was with him.

It has these curious specifications:
- 2 × 10-in aluminium cones - I have never seen another subwoofer with two big cones like this.
- 200-watt amplifier
- 16.9″ × 23.3″ × 6″ (7.8″ incl. base)
 - 29 lb

I have generally been impressed by this subwoofer. Most subwoofers people show me are too loud, and sound like mud to me. This is the first subwoofer I've owned where I've sought out a variety of bass sounds to see what it could reproduce, such as:

- the MANY bass sounds in [[Movies/Dune Part 2 (2024)\|Dune Part 2 (2024)]]
- the helicopters in Michael Bay's [[Movies/Transformers (2007)\|Transformers (2007)]]

For those who like audiophile jargon, the following snippets from Sound & Vision might be of interest:

> The V Woofer did a fine job filling in the missing octaves down to perhaps 35 Hz, but it didn't seem to have a great deal of oomph much lower. The same Taylor CD carries about as much bass level as you'll find on a pop production, making it ideal for checking sub/sat blend and flatness. Although the V Large speakers matched well with the V Woofer through the crossover zone, the system initially sounded a bit heavy around 60 Hz, which may have robbed it of some bottom-octaves impact. In any case, moving the V Woofer to the corner improved evenness noticeably and upped the perceived deep-bass impact somewhat.

> The V Woofer had limited low-end dynamics, averaging 95 dB from 25 to 62 Hz, and hitting max SPL of 104 dB at 50 Hz

> The V Woofer also did a solid job of filling out the bottom end of _Casino Royale_'s Bondesque musical score and big-action explosive effects; like the full system, it could reach surprisingly high levels without audible strain. But it lacked the bottom-octave, earth-moving ability to bring out everything that big-ticket film sound has to offer. For example, in the sequence where a building implodes and submerges (an everyday occurrence in Venice, I'm sure), there was plenty of rumble - almost to the point of localizing the sub a bit - but not all of the deep, seismic sensation I knew to be in the recording. In a level-matched comparison with my everyday sub, my reference woofer damped the rumble a bit and revealed plenty of the extra-deep stuff - though I hasten to add that this sub costs almost as much as the entire Verve system.
