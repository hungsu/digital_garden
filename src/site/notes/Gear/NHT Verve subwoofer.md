# NHT V Woofer

![20250820 NHT Verve subwoofer.jpg](/img/user/20250820%20NHT%20Verve%20subwoofer.jpg)

A [[Unsorted/subwoofer\|subwoofer]] I bought from FB Marketplace. I wasn't expecting to buy it - I was meeting the seller for the [[Gear/NHT M5 monitor\|NHT M5 monitor]], who offered me this while I was with him.

It has these curious specifications:
- 2 × 10-in aluminium cones - I have never seen another subwoofer with two big cones like this.
- 200-watt amplifier
- 16.9″ × 23.3″ × 6″ (7.8″ incl. base)
 - 29 lb
 - 38Hz–240Hz

I have generally been impressed by this subwoofer. Most subwoofers people show me are too loud, and sound like mud to me. This is the first subwoofer I've owned where I've sought out a variety of bass sounds to see what it could reproduce, such as:

- the MANY bass sounds in [[Movies/Dune Part 2 (2024)\|Dune Part 2 (2024)]]
- the helicopters in Michael Bay's [[Movies/Transformers (2007)\|Transformers (2007)]]

For those who like audiophile jargon, the following snippets from Sound & Vision might be of interest:

> Those familiar with the sound of typical vented woofers might find the V Woofer’s bass initially seems somewhat more lightly balanced, but the offsetting benefit is that the NHT’s bass also tends to sound tighter, punchier, and better-defined (different strokes for different folks).

> ...when cranking up the volume, be aware that the V Woofer has less dynamic headroom...If you accidentally push the sub beyond its limits, as happened to us when playing the “Under Attack” battle scene from Master and Commander at exuberant volumes, the V Woofer may shut itself down (the woofer’s power light remains lit, but bass output just goes away). If shutdown occurs, simply toggle the power switch to reset the woofer.

> The V Woofer did a fine job filling in the missing octaves down to perhaps 35 Hz, but it didn't seem to have a great deal of oomph much lower...moving the V Woofer to the corner improved evenness noticeably and upped the perceived deep-bass impact somewhat.
