# 7Hertz Timeless earphones

Quite possibly the best bang for buck audiophile earphones around.

I bought mine from [Linsoul for $220](https://www.linsoul.com/collections/all-archived/products/7hz-timeless) with a 3.5mm termination.

Are [[Private/planar earphones\|planar earphones]]. I don't fully understand what this means, but [[People/crinacle\|crinacle]] explains in this [19 minute video](https://youtu.be/tuTOq9hJp94) .

Uses [[Private/MMCX cable\|MMCX cable]], so these can be used over Bluetooth with a bluetooth MMCX cable. I used a [Fiio MMCX Bluetooth cable](https://www.amazon.com/FiiO-Bluetooth-Lightweight-Headphone-Replacement/dp/B07D8J8CJ9).

[[People/crinacle\|crinacle]] did a video review of these on Youtube:
- Notes that some people find it fatigueing, because it has sharp treble
