# 7Hertz Timeless earphones

Quite possibly the best bang for buck audiophile earphones around.

I bought mine from [Linsoul for $220](https://www.linsoul.com/collections/all-archived/products/7hz-timeless)

Are planar earphones. I don't fully understand what this means, but [[Private/crinacle\|crinacle]] explains in this [19 minute video](https://youtu.be/tuTOq9hJp94) .

Uses [[Private/MMCX cable\|MMCX cable]], so I was able to use them over Bluetooth with a Fiio MMCX Bluetooth cable.

[[Private/crinacle\|crinacle]] did a video review of these on Youtube:
- Notes that some people find it fatigueing, because it has sharp treble
- Gave them an A- grade on his [website](https://crinacle.com/rankings/iems/), which is astonishingly high, and are the cheapest earphones at that grade. The most expensive at that grade is $3200.
