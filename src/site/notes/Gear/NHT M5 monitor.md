# NHT M5 Monitor

![20250501 1757 MHT M5.jpg](/img/user/Embeds/20250501%201757%20MHT%20M5.jpg)

A passive 3 way [[Unsorted/loudspeaker\|loudspeaker]], which I bought for [[Unsorted/Linus Tech Tips said I should build my own home theatre\|my home theater system]]. It's possibly the best speaker I've ever owned. 

## Why I went looking for it

Somewhere in my internet travels I came across the idea that the [[Unsorted/center channel speaker\|centre channel]] of a home audio system is the most important (aside from the [[Unsorted/subwoofer\|subwoofer]]) because it plays almost all the most important audio. I heard one recommendation that a centre channel should be effective across the 120–20000Hz range, but particularly in the 120–8000Hz range, which covers most human speech. 

Doing this well requires a variety of drivers. For example, the NHT M5 covers a wide range like so:
- A 5" woofer to handle 66Hz–450Hz
- A 3" driver to handle 450Hz–3000Hz
- A 1" tweeter to handle 3000Hz–30000Hz

If you were to make or buy a speaker without a variety of drivers, such as only 3" drivers, it would find itself utterly unable to represent low and high ranges. Unfortunately, many of the cheap soundbars and speakers available to consumers are guilty of this:

This promotional poster triumphantly shows a speaker design with 4 drivers that are all the same size. This speaker is intended to be used as soundbar for movies, and without even hearing it myself, I know it would sound awful.

Thus I went hunting for a high quality 3 way speaker: one robust box with at least 3 different sized drivers.

## How I found my ideal centre speaker

Looking for new 3-way speakers was not promising. The enclosing box must be large and robust enough for at least 3 drivers, together with the cost of all the drivers and internal wiring, seems to jack the price up significantly more than simpler designs. The cheapest new speaker with a 3-way design seems to be the [SVS Prime Center](https://www.amazon.com/SVS-Prime-Center-Speaker-Premium/dp/B00PASUGTC/?th=1), and at $450USD, I was absolutely not interested. Thus I moved on to second hand markets. 

Doing a search for "3 way speaker"  on Facebook marketplace yields plenty of results, but most were far too large, like these:
![marketplace-3-way-speakers.jpg](/img/user/marketplace-3-way-speakers.jpg)
These designs would surely sound excellent. 3 way designs seem common in older speakers - audio engineers seemed wise to that configuration being effective. Unfortunately, I needed a much smaller design to use as a center channel.

I switched to searching for "center speaker" for a while, and tried looking for designs that were 3 way. With patience and sheer luck, I found the NHT M5  unit, very nearby, for just $80USD. Also through sheer luck, the seller had his [[Unsorted/NHT Verve subwoofer\|NHT Verve subwoofer]] for sale, which I happily bought.

## Other notes

The M5 is originally part of a set released in 2002, the NHT M5 Evolution. It was highly acclaimed at the time:

> Turning my attention to the M5 center speaker, I found that it matched its flanking pair superbly when I compared them using a mono source. In fact, the match on both male and female voices was as good as I’ve heard, and it held up remarkably well off-axis, which means people sitting at opposite ends of a sofa close to the front of the room will hear the same smooth sound. A big factor in getting so excellent a match is the Boundary switch on the M5’s back panel that cuts its mid-bass output if the speaker is close to reflective surfaces like walls — or a large video screen.[^1]

> Oriented horizontally, the M5 had even smoother response, with virtually identical directivity from on-axis to 30° off-axis and relatively moderate lobing beyond that, making it one of the better-measuring center speakers I’ve tested. Given the symmetrical pattern, I wouldn’t hesitate using the M5 horizontally.[^1]

It can be used vertically as a satellite speaker, and can also be mounted onto a NHT B5 subwoofer, making it into a [NHT T5 Tower Speaker](https://www.avsforum.com/threads/nht-t5-vs-t6.310137/).

Being released in 2002 these are very hard to buy today. I occasionally see listings for them online, at modest prices.

As of 2023, the successor to these speakers seems to be the [M7 LCR speaker](https://www.nhthifi.com/products/m-7-lcr-speaker-single). The m7 is quite expensive at $900 per speaker, and much heavier at 32 pounds!

It's the largest single passive loudspeaker I've ever owned. It weighs 21 pounds,  having 2 5.25" woofers, a 3" midrange and a 1" aluminium dome tweeter, and has these specs:

|                             |                                      |

It has *acoustic suspension*, but I do not know what that means.

Came with a grille which I've stored in my garage for now.

The company, Now Hear This, is in California between San Francisco and Sacramento.
