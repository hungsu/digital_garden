# MINISFORUM mini-ITX motherboard
![minisforum-bd790i.png](/img/user/Embeds/minisforum-bd790i.png)

This motherboard, and this category of motherboards, has totally changed how I think of [[Unsorted/How to build a computer\|PC building]]. It combines what is usually 3 separate components into one:
- CPU
	- Mine is [Ryzen 9 7940HX](https://www.amd.com/en/products/processors/laptop/ryzen/7000-series/amd-ryzen-9-7940hx.html). Has sixteen [Zen 4]() CPU cores, 32 threads on a 5nm process.
- motherboard
- CPU heatsink

This leaves just a few steps to finish a PC build:
- case - usually an easy choice, just pick one you happen to like and will fit your GPU of choice. Mine is a [[Unsorted/Louqe Ghost S1\|Louqe Ghost S1]].
- power supply - which is usually an easy choice, and something that may come for free with a case.
- RAM - Also usually an easy choice for non-overclockers. I used the cheapest 32GB of DDR5-5600 I could find, which it seems to have correctly clocked down to 5200. It supports up to 64GB, but I have felt no need to have that much.
- A CPU fan - Another easy choice , any 120mm fan. I used the [NOCTUA NF-F12](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00KFCR5BA).
- An SSD. There are many "best SSD" guides, such as [this one from Tom's Hardware](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-ssds,3891.html), that make this easy.
- optionally a video card. Unfortunately a fairly difficult choice you will still have to make. You can go without, which may give the advantage of making it simpler to connect this to an external dock. But the onboard 610M is awful for any games.

I will very likely be using only this type of motherboard for my gaming PCs in future. The CPU performance is excellent and I greatly appreciated the ease of building.

## Technical things of note

Mine does NOT have wi-fi or bluetooth.

The motherboard has a single [[Unsorted/2.5Gb ethernet\|2.5Gbe]] port, which supports [[wake on LAN\|wake on LAN]].

Its 2 m.2 2280 slots have built in heatsink and fan. Note these are [[Unsorted/PCIe 4.0\|PCIE Gen 4]], not 5.

Mine has BIOS version 1.09 installed. 1.12 seems to exist but judging from this [Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/sffpc/comments/1iu0a8z/new_bios_for_minisforum_bd790ise_021325/), there seems to be no real advantage to updating to it
