# Paikesi

My first folding [[Unsorted/Bicycle\|bike]], bought from a bike store in Makati, Philippines for a mere $503.92USD in 2024.

![20241107_1506 Pikes bike shopping cart mode.jpg](/img/user/Embeds/20241107_1506%20Pikes%20bike%20shopping%20cart%20mode.jpg)

I bought it primarily for this "shopping cart" mode. I regularly ride mine to the nearby supermarket, with a basket mounted to the front to carry groceries. It turns heads almost every single time I go there.

This bike is a clone of a popular folding bike, the Brompton. It has a number of difference from Bromptons, including one advantage you can see in the above photo - the "shopping cart" mode can be done with one fold or two. Bromptons require two folds.

The company is Indonesian, but their [website](https://www.elementbike.id/) doesn't seem to have this bike listed anymore.

## Parts and specs

Came with a [[Unsorted/Brompton block\|Brompton block]] on the front already.

### Drivetrain

[[Unsorted/chainring\|chainring]] is 5 bolts in a 130mm bolt circle diameter, or 130BCD. Originally came with 45T chainring, mine has since swapped to 38T.

Has a [[Unsorted/Sturmey Archer SRF3\|Sturmey Archer SRF3]] internal gear hub , controlled by thumb shifter on right handle:
- Gear 1 75%
- Gear 2 100%
- Gear 3 133%
- Weight: 970g

Also has 15T and 13T sprockets attached to the gear hub, controlled by shifter on left handle. 

[This](https://www.carousell.ph/p/pikes-gen-4-brompton-style-folding-bike-with-accessories-1162944318/) person put a Sturmey Archer [5 speed internal gear hub](https://www.sturmey-archer.com/en/products/detail/rx-rf5) on their Pikes. Weighs 1950g, so adds 1kg of weight.

This [video](https://youtu.be/-Q9wd8Ewlec?si=knmxQ1P7XdnLpPU1) might be useful to me later if I want to increase gearing.

### Wheels

Like Brompton, it has 16" wheels. [Brompton website](https://global.brompton.com/support/knowledge/what-is-the-recommended-tyre-pressure-for-my-brompton) recommends pressure between 65 and 100 PSI, so I have mine at around 80 PSI. There is [debate](https://www.reddit.com/r/Brompton/comments/vmzch6/what_tire_pressure_do_you_run_your_brompton_at/) around what pressure is ideal, but I don't understand it all.

Unlike Brompton, I have to use [bike tubes with long valves](https://www.schwalbetires.com/SCHWALBE-TUBE-ITEM-4-16-18-10410310). Standard Brompton tubes have short valves that I can't get an air pump onto.

The rear wheel fork has a space for a plastic pump, but I've removed this pump because it doesn't work very well.

Removing the rear wheel is complex because of the internal gear hub. My local bike shop charges me $40USD to remove the wheel and replace the tube, and that's with me supplying the tube.

This person heavily modified their Pikes Gen 4, with many titanium and Aceoffix parts.

same person did initial impression 2022 june, but it appears to already have some modifications https://youtu.be/cNItTkfxBqo?si=OlSY4zpLLiz1VQAO

Can be made into a [[Unsorted/DIY ebike\|DIY ebike]], but this costs more than an entire ebike:
