This tiny device adds some neat possibilities to travel, and here's one example.

On a long flight across the Pacific Ocean, I was flying in a party of 5. The flight had Wi-Fi, but this required payment. We weren't about to pay $16USD Ã— 5, so instead:
1. We paid once for unlimited Wi-Fi
2. I logged into the plane's Wi-Fi with this router
3. We all connected to this router for fast Wi-Fi 6 between us.

The Beryl is very low power, so I was able to power it from a plain USB port and fit it between our seats below:

Once the Beryl had internet, everyone in our party instantly had internet since they had connected to its Wi-Fi before! And so for our long flight we all had unlimited internet, fast enough to stream TV shows! ðŸ˜Š

This device is strictly for wi-fi while travelling - at home I use a [[Gear/NanoPi R5S router\|NanoPi R5S router]] and [[Gear/Unifi U7 Pro Wall\|Unifi U7 Pro Wall]].
