This tiny little device is something that adds some neat possibilities to travel, and here's one example.

On an 18 hour flight across the Pacific Ocean, I was in a party of 5. The flight had Wi-Fi, but this required payment. We weren't about to pay 5 times, so instead, my wife paid once, and then we used this to share Wi-Fi between the 5 of us. The Beryl is very low power, so I was able to power it from a plain USB port and fit it between our seats below:

Once the Beryl had internet, everyone in our party instantly had internet since they had connected to its Wi-Fi before! And so for our long flight we all had internet ðŸ˜Š
