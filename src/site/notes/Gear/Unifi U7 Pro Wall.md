# U7 Pro Wall

My first [[Private/WiFi 7\|WiFi 7]] [[Private/WiFi Access Point\|access point]], from [[Private/Unifi\|Unifi]]. I paid $230.53USD for it including shipping, and $33.08 for a PoE+ adapter.

I installed mine with CAT 6 cable for 2.5GBe, a PoE+ injector, and free standing behind my TV. There is an official stand, but it costs $30 which I feel is robbery. The device has a flat bottom and happily stands up by itself, if you have a flat surface.

I have no WiFi 7 devices, but in my own tests with a [[Gear/Lenovo Flex 7 laptop\|Wi-Fi 6E device]], I was able to get 800mb/s transfer speeds. I've heard of people getting [900Mb/s](https://youtu.be/CRTeSLqu8Vw?si=9Pgj0nOuxwXyH8BO) or even [1600Mb/s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFoEuSbMi_U&t=320s).

## Bad things

It gets uncomfortably warm: 99°F/37°C on the back, 46°C on the front https://youtu.be/GFoEuSbMi_U?si=3dG4N0qblZiztiN5

 I intend to buy another one when my [[Gear/Unifi AC Lite\|Unifi AC Lite]] fails, but it has stubbornly refused to do so.
