My favourite computer mouse

Has these features:
- Low latency
- Cheap, $35USD for the black version
- The right number of buttons for me
- Lightweight
- [[Gear/AA battery\|AA battery]] powered - so unlike other mice with built in batteries which will eventually die completely, this is future proof!
- Modding community - mainly to make it lighter
- Does not use bluetooth
- USB receiver stored inside the mouse. I was infuriated by my previous mouse, a G703 whose receiver I constantly feared losing.
