# Lenovo Flex 7 laptop

A convertible 14" [[Unsorted/Laptop\|laptop]] that replaced my [[Gear/ASUS ROG Flow X13 (2021)\|ASUS ROG Flow X13 (2021)]] .

## What I like about it

*SO CHEAP*. I could have bought *THREE* of these for the cost of my previous laptop. I bought it for only $529.43 including tax, making it the cheapest laptop I've bought in my life. I found the deal on Reddit's [Laptop Deals](https://www.reddit.com/r/LaptopDeals/).

*Excellent battery life*. It's well known that x86 laptops have worse battery life than [[Unsorted/M1\|Apple silicon]], but this laptop with its [[Unsorted/asymmetrical CPU\|asymmetrical CPU]] and 59Wh battery have never actually run out of power on me. No battery anxiety!

Small size at 14". I've owned 15.6" and 16" laptops before, and they are just a little too big for many situations I'm in: small tables at coffee shops, small airplane trays, even in the car. A 14" can work in surprisingly more situations where a 16" laptop really cannot.

Has [[Unsorted/Thunderbolt interface\|Thunderbolt 4]] so I could attach an [[Unsorted/EGPU\|EGPU]] in future, which should mitigate it's biggest downside below.

Low power consumption. It uses a 65W power brick, making it easier to charge than my previous laptop that wanted 100W and simpler to find USB-C docking stations for. It's a nightmare trying to find a docking station that will charge 100W while also providing sufficient IO.

Text looks wonderful on the display. Great [[Unsorted/pixel density\|pixel density]] at 188PPI.

Physical switch on the webcam. For some shocking reason, many laptops do not have this, opting for only a light indicator to let you know if the webcam is on, but this too can be hacked. A physical switch is a rare example of something unhackable.

It has a [[touchscreen\|touchscreen]] and is convertible, like my [[Gear/ASUS ROG Flow X13 (2021)\|last laptop]]. I constantly use it in tent mode for a clean two display setup, and the touchscreen I use constantly, most commonly so I can hand it to people in my house to choose which food items they want delivered.



## What I don't like


Performance dips. Despite excellent benchmarks of the [[Unsorted/Intel 1355U\|Intel 1355U]] CPU, I frequently encounter moments of slowness on even mundane tasks like typing into Obsidian. 

Cooling is bad. There is only one vent - at the bottom of the laptop. This easily is obstructed when using the laptop in bed.

*Awful GPU*. GPU is Iris XE, which is awful. Even ancient games like Starcraft 2 do not run well on it, limiting me to simple 3D or 2D games. I have seen it at over 90% utilisation when doing just desktop tasks. This is its weakest point and the one thing I want to change the most.

Only one USB-C port. Sometimes I want to charge from the right side, but I cannot.

*Ergonomics*. Front edge where wrist rests is a bit sharp. Also the Up and down arrow keys are a bit small and hard to press.

Touchpad. Sometimes touchpad doesn't respond if I'm using keyboard at the same time. I am generally fine to use pure touchpad on my work Macbook, but this touchpad has me often reaching for a mouse, even in bed.

Screen is only 60Hz
