# Denon AVR-S510BT receiver

My third [[Unsorted/AV receiver\|AV receiver]], and the first that works.

A few key features motivated me to choose this:
- Supports 4K@60Hz! On only 3 ports (3, 4, 5), but that's more than I need
- Can up mix stereo to 5.1. It has two ways to do this: Dolby PL II, and DTS Neo:6.

It has one glaring disadvantage - it does NOT support HDMI CEC. Members of my household continually complain that there is no sound from the home theatre, which I inevitably find is because the receiver did not turn on when they turned on the TV.
