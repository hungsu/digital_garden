# Viture One

A wearable display, the size of some large glasses. It replaced my portable monitor.

My first pair of [[Private/display glasses\|display glasses]].

## Advantages

Improves [[Private/posture\|posture]] since one does not have to look down at screen anymore

Have a 3D mode for 3D videos, so that two different video frames can play to each eye. Works well, but unfortunately it's very difficult to find 1080P 3D content

## Downers

A bit fuzzy toward the edges

When using with phone, any limitations of [[Samsung DeX\|Samsung DeX]]  still apply, plus:
- sideways animations make me slightly motion sick

Is only 60Hz
