# Peak Design Everyday Case

[Store page](https://www.peakdesign.com/products/everyday-case-samsung)

A line of cases from [[Private/Peak design\|Peak design]], that I have installed on my [[Gear/Samsung Galaxy S22\|Samsung Galaxy S22]] so that I can use [[Private/MagSafe\|MagSafe]].

Until [[Private/Smartphone\|Smartphone]]s adopt [[Private/Qi2\|Qi2]], I'll likely continue buying these cases

## Things I like

The **magnet**. It's positioned so that wireless charging works well - the Samsung's Qi charging coil is slightly below centre. I have tried in the past to use a circular magnetic sticker, but because Qi charging creates heat, that melts the glue of the sticker causing the phone to fall off wireless charging stands.

## Things I don't

The **texture**. It traps visible specks of dust that can be annoying to remove.

The USB-C port opening. It is smaller than my previous case, and now my charging cable does not fit.
