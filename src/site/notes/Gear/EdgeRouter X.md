# EdgeRouter X

A [[Private/Network router\|Network router]], with a 880 MHz CPU, same as [[Gear/Mikrotik RB750GR3 router\|Mikrotik RB750GR3 router]]

Is so slow, it can be beaten by a [[Private/Raspberry Pi 4\|Raspberry Pi 4]].  https://forum.openwrt.org/t/help-selecting-a-dedicated-router-gigabit-poe-pppoe-support-sfp-nice-to-have/92940/2 
I personally could only get around 500Mb/s download speed with this.

At $59USD + shipping this was a total waste of money for me. I've since replaced it with a [[Private/NanoPi R5S\|NanoPi R5S]] and am getting much better speeds.
