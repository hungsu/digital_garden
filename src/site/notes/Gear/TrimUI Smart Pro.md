# TrimUI Smart Pro

A teeny tiny [[Unsorted/ARM handheld\|handheld game console]] for nerds, that I bought for $51.52USD including shipping in 2024.

It runs a slimmed down version of Linux, which can run many emulated console games, and a limited number of PC games.

It's possible to install a variant of Android on this called [GammaOS](https://github.com/TheGammaSqueeze/GammaOSCore), but I have not tried.

It's a little smaller than [[Gear/Nintendo Switch\|Nintendo Switch]] and a little bigger than my [[Gear/Samsung Galaxy S22\|Samsung Galaxy S22]]. Has Nintendo style button layout on right, which i'm not the biggest fan of as I happen to prefer Xbox and PlayStation style layouts.


Of all the cheap handhelds of 2024, this has the biggest and best screen: 4.96" 1280 Ã— 720p. This is perhaps a bit of a waste since this device is intended to play classic games that have a 4:3 ratio, but I have also enjoyed playing some widescreen games on it such as [[Unsorted/Dust Elysian Tale\|Dust Elysian Tale]] and [[Videogames/Balatro (2024)\|Balatro (2024)]].

Has quite meagre specifications:
- Allwinner A133P 1.8GHz CPU
- 1GB DDR4 RAM. Together these have prevented me from running more demanding emulators and games, such as Hyper Light Drifter and a lot of Nintendo 64 games like Super Smash Bros 64.
- 5000mAh battery, which lasts me around 2 hours

I installed a custom layer over the base operating system, called Crossmix OS, which adds a variety of neat features:
- [[Unsorted/Moonlight\|Moonlight]] for streaming games from [[Gear/my computer\|my computer]], which works well on the device but I've found that the device's weak CPU and RAM seem only able to handle a bitrate of 2.5Mbps. I've observed [one person](https://www.reddit.com/r/trimui/comments/1frgl0u/testing_moonlight_crossmix_os/) say that Moonlight works better at 30FPS on the device, but I'd rather keep the high framerate.
- Function switch remapping - there's a 2-mod switch on the bottom of the device, and its purpose can be defined to do all kinds of things. I set mine to put my console in Turbo mode for more CPU intensive tasks. Note that this seems to make the back of the device quite warm.
- SMB hosting, so when the device connects to WiFi, I can see it as a network drive from my desktop PC. This lets me easily copy game files to it
- Saving state on power off, and booting into saved state on power on

## Notes for me and others who own it

The [r/trimui subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/trimui/) has made a useful website, [TrimUI Hub](https://destructiveburn.com/TrimUIHub/).
