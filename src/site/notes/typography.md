# Typography

> [!QUOTE] Ellen Lupton
> Typography is what language looks like. #quote

Typography is the art of choosing typefaces and arranging type to make written language legible and beautiful. 

Made up of some smaller skills including:

- [[Font selection\|Font selection]], particularly how to choose readable fonts for body and titles.
- [[Private/Typesetting\|Typesetting]], including font size, leading, justification, and line length.
- [[punctuation\|Punctuation]], particularly how to avoid ugly approximations.

## My favourite examples

[[Videogames/Pentiment\|Pentiment]] is a videogame featuring phenomenal typography as a way of communicating character social standing. The game created original Typefaces just for the game, by studying historical texts, which you can read about in great length in the [Lettermatic case study](https://lettermatic.com/custom/pentiment).

## Related and helpful skills

Typography is improved greatly with [[Private/Colour selection for UI\|Colour selection for UI]].

A core skill for [[Concepts/UI design\|UI design]], and in my opinion, a crucial but underrated skill of [UI engineering](UI%20engineering.md).

Is somewhat related to, but different from Penmanship and [[Private/calligraphy\|calligraphy]].
