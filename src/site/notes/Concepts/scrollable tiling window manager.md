# Scrollable tiled panes

A [[Private/UI pattern\|UI pattern]], where the user can create new Panes or Windows that take up the full height available, and display to one side. An alternative to Tabs.

<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(81.23% + 44px)'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/WastefulClearAsp' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>


## Advantages

**Maintained context**. Often when you go from one link to another, you still need information from the original. Opening things in a new adjacent pane helps you keep context. Opening a new tab moves the original content out of sight.



## Examples

For your computer:

- [[Software/Obsidian\|Obsidian]] features a "stack tabs" mode.
- [[Software/PaperWM\|PaperWM]] - A window manager for Linux GNOME. My personal favourite
- [CardboardWM](https://gitlab.com/cardboardwm/cardboard) - Have to build yourself, so perhaps only software engineers and hackers should look. Made by a uni student with no time. This [blog post](https://www.ctrl.blog/entry/cardboardwm.html) details one person's adventures with it.
- [EndlessWM](https://github.com/peterfajdiga/EndlessWM#readme) Another window manager for Linux, but Wayland. No updates since 2020
