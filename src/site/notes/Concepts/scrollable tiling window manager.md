# Scrollable tiled panes

A [[UI pattern\|UI pattern]], where the user can create new Panes or Windows that take up the full height available, and display to one side. An alternative to Tabs.

<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(81.23% + 44px)'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/WastefulClearAsp' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>


## Advantages

**Maintained context**. Often when you go from one link to another, you still need information from the original. Opening things in a new tab moves the original content out of sight. This interface let's you see both at once.
