# Interstitial journaling

A journaling style and productivity method. When you *change contexts*, write in your journal the current time and some sentences on what you just did and thought. Then write the [[Private/Next action\|Next action]].

I have found it helpful for my [[ADHD\|ADHD]] as a way of engaging my [[Private/Executive function\|Executive function]]. The act of typing is a kind of fidgeting, and writing the next action is executive function in action. 

## Tools for interstitial journaling

I do this with a [[Private/Mechanical keyboard\|Mechanical keyboard]] for improved effectiveness. My Macbook's keyboard is noticeably less satisfying for journaling.

I use [[Software/Obsidian\|Obsidian]] and [[Software/Logseq\|Logseq]] for all my journaling, using a daily note template. Tony Stubblebine [recommends](https://www.nbcnews.com/better/lifestyle/how-interstitial-journaling-can-help-you-focus-your-day-work-ncna1036166) that you do NOT go looking for a new "perfect" app or paper for this - use what you have.
