# Display font

A [[Private/Font\|typeface]] designed specifically for display usage at large sizes, to attract attention and create emotion.

Can be identified by the keyword _Display_ in the name, such as [[Private/Playfair Display\|Playfair Display]]. Occasionally may have these keywords instead: _Headline_, _Banner_, _Poster_, _Big_, _Titling_ or _Fine_.

Display faces tend to have higher stroke contrast, tighter spacing and more intricate details. They are more likely to have excellent [[Private/Ligature\|ligatures]].

## Using Display type in your body text is a mistake

Using display type in body text causes a variety of issues:
- The letters are spaced too close together at this size
- strokes are too thin, making text very hard to read. Lowercase `e` becomes `c`.
