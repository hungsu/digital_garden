# Display font

A [[Private/Font\|typeface]] designed specifically for display usage at large sizes, to attract attention and create emotion.

Can be identified by the keyword _Display_ in the name, such as [[Private/Playfair Display\|Playfair Display]]. Occasionally may have these keywords instead: _Headline_, _Banner_, _Poster_, _Big_, _Titling_ or _Fine_.

Display faces tend to have higher stroke contrast, tighter spacing and more intricate details. They are more likely to have excellent [[Private/Ligature\|ligatures]].

## Using Display type in your body text is a mistake

This line you are reading is in a Body or Text typeface, designed to be used in this way.

<p style="font-family: 'Playfair Display', serif;">This paragraph, is using a display typeface instead. You may notice it feels odd to read, especially as you read each line. Rather than adjusting to it, reading words likes this feels increasingly uncomfortable.</p>

Using display type in body text causes a variety of issues:
- The letter spacing or tracking, which is ideal at large sizes, is too tight for body text.
- Some details like serifs are too small and are lost
- Languages, weights, styles are usually fewer
- Strokes can seem to disappear, making text very hard to read. Lowercase `e` becomes `c`.
