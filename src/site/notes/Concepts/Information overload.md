# Information overload

> [!quote] Arthur Schopenhauer
> A constant flow of thoughts expressed by other people can stop and deaden your own thought and your own initiative.

The state of having so much information available it paralyses the person. Effects include choice paralysis, outrage.

Caused and aggravated by [[Private/social network\|social media]].

In response:
- Collect quotes that tell you not to do it
	- The purpose of knowledge is action, not knowledge.
	- Knowledge isn't free. You have to pay attention  Feynman
	- Information is not truth
	- If I were the plaything of every thought, I would be a fool, not a wise man.
