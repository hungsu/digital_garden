# ADHD procrastination

> [!warning]
> The following is my own experience and is not professional psychiatric advice.

ADHD procrastination is a cycle of anxious, frustrating, hugely effortful attempts and failures to begin and finish work that is important to me.[^1] By contrast, common [[Concepts/procrastination\|procrastination]] means seeing the task, and choosing to do something else, typically enjoying whatever that alternative is. 

For example, common procrastination might be me seeing chores that need doing, and playing videogames instead. Not a single thought is given to the chores while I play the videogames.

By contrast, in ADHD procrastination I may possibly choose play videogames too, but will be thinking about the task while playing. Additionally, if I choose to do the task, I will sit at the computer, programs open, everything ready to work, but nothing is done. Entire days will be lost like this. As guilt grows, I will reject invitations to spend time with others, because I know I should do this task. I will even get angry at people inviting me to do fun things - an example of *emotional dysregulation* discussed later. I am not avoiding the task in the classic sense - I am expending immense mental effort trying to set myself up to do and succeed at the task. One may believe me to be incompetent, but in truth I have the skills needed to perform the task.  I want to do the task, I understand the Importance of the task, I have the tools for the task, but cannot do it. I have executive dysfunction. This is ADHD procrastination.

For me, what makes this especially elusive to solve is that my executive function does work sometimes. This is where advice from neurotypical people does not help, as having intermittent or broken executive function as an adult is outside their experience. They gained executive function as they aged, so they see broken executive function as me being a child who should grow up.

Additionally, when others ask me about my progress, I’d have to admit I didn’t get much done or worse, lie. This is *ADHD masking*

## How to solve ADHD procrastination

The most important starting point is to realise I am in ADHD procrastination and not common procrastination, thus it is generally a problem of executive function and not of fear.

Next, the most consistently reliable method involves some kind of social accountability to get my executive function working well.  [[Private/coworking\|coworking]] or [[Private/pair programming\|pair programming]] seem to be the way. I have generally found [[Private/scrum\|scrum]] or stand-up meetings to be very ineffective.
