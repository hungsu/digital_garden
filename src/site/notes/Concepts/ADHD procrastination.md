ADHD procrastination is a cycle of anxious, frustrating, hugely effortful attempts and failures to begin and finish work that is important to you. By contrast, common [[Public/Procrastination\|Procrastination]] spends no attention on the task, typically enjoying life in the process. 

For example, I have a task I have been given at work. It has been three weeks since I committed to doing the task. I will reject offers to spend time with others, because I know I should do this task. I will even get annoyed at invitations to fun things, because I know I must reject them while this task is overdue. I am not avoiding it in the lazy sense - I am expending immense mental effort trying to set myself up to do and succeed at the task, entire days are lost looking at a computer screen trying to achieve the task, but nothing is done. I understand the Importance of the task, but cannot do it. This is ADHD procrastination.

Additionally, when others ask me about my progress, I’d have to admit I didn’t get much done or worse, lie. This is *ADHD masking*
