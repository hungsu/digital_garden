# ADHD procrastination

ADHD procrastination is a cycle of anxious, frustrating, hugely effortful attempts and failures to begin and finish work that is important to you.[^1] By contrast, common [[Concepts/procrastination\|procrastination]] spends no attention on the task, typically enjoying life in the process. 

For example, common procrastination might be a student playing videogames instead of doing homework. They are not devoting even a single thought to the homework as they procrastinate.

By contrast, if I choose to play videogames instead of my task, I will be thinking about the task as I play. I will reject offers to spend time with others, because I know I should do this task. I will even get annoyed at people inviting me to do such things - an example of *emotional dysregulation* discussed later. I am not avoiding the task in the classic sense - I am expending immense mental effort trying to set myself up to do and succeed at the task. One may believe me to be incompetent, but in truth I have the skills needed to perform the task. I will sit at the computer, programs open, everything ready, to work, entire days like this, but nothing is done. I want to do the task, I understand the Importance of the task, I have the tools for the task, but cannot do it. I have executive dysfunction. This is ADHD procrastination.

For me, what makes this especially elusive to solve is that my executive function does work sometimes. This is where advice from neurotypical people does not help, as having intermittent or broken executive function as an adult is outside their experience. They gained executive function as they aged, so they see broken executive function as me being a child who should grow up.

Additionally, when others ask me about my progress, I’d have to admit I didn’t get much done or worse, lie. This is *ADHD masking*

## How to solve ADHD procrastination

The most consistently reliable method involves some kind of social accountability.  [[Private/coworking\|coworking]] or [[Private/pair programming\|pair programming]] seem to be the way. I have generally found [[Private/scrum\|scrum]] to be ineffective.
