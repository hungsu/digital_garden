# Mini LED

A type of [[Private/Computer monitor\|computer display]] technology.

In my opinion, not worth the money. I briefly owned an AOC Mini LED, which meets the DisplayHDR1000 spec. After watching some HDR videos on YouTube and trying to watch some HDR content on Amazon Prime Video and playing some HDR games, I returned the monitor the following day.

This [7m48s video](https://youtu.be/HlAfTw_gc9U?si=jhyZGEuXy3dPKbAo) details nicely the differences between Mini LED versus OLED.
