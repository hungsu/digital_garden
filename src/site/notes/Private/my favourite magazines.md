# My favourite magazines

I define a magazine as having multiple writers, frequent publication, and funding from ads and subscriptions.

For magazines without ads, check out [[Slow news movement\|Slow journalism]].

For blogs with only one writer, [[My favourite blogs\|my favourite blogs and digital gardens]].

## The list

[The Good Trade](https://www.thegoodtrade.com/) is extremely pretty and has some notable articles, like [How To Respond To Someone Who Is Grieving](https://www.thegoodtrade.com/features/how-to-respond-to-someone-who-is-grieving/)

[Serve The Home](https://www.servethehome.com/) is a magazine for [[self hosting\|self hosting]]. I go here for networking hardware news.

[National Geographic](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/) is one of the most gorgeous magazines of all time. Photographers who work there shape the entire photography industry

## The contentious

[[Private/Wired magazine\|Wired magazine]] was once one of my most beloved tech magazines, particularly in the 90s when they were a print magazine. I bought a digital subscription from them in 2022 but found myself skimming, disagreeing, and otherwise getting no value from them.

[[Private/The Wirecutter\|The Wirecutter]] is a consumer product reviews magazine acquired by The New York Times. Is slightly infamous, to the point where people who read Wirecutter are judged for their laziness. As an alternative, there are [RTINGS.com](https://www.rtings.com/) and [Consumer Reports](https://www.consumerreports.org/)
