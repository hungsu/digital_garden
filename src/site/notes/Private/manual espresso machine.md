# Manual espresso machine

A machine that makes [[Private/espresso\|espresso]], using physical forces to create the required pressure, rather than electricity. 

Usually requires hot water, but not always. Thus creates interesting possibility of making cold espresso.

Can range in price from $65USD to $1500USD

My personal favourite is the [[Gear/Hugh Leverpresso\|Hugh Leverpresso]]. I've also tried the Flair Espresso Pro, and don't recommend it.

The MHW-3BOMBER from [AliExpress](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256805632324362.html?spm=a1z65.store_weex_home.slider_2008443424000.0&gatewayAdapt=glo2usa4itemAdapt) looks interesting, but at $650 I'm unlikely to ever try it.
