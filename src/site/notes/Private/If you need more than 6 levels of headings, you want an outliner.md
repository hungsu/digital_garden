When writing documents, it can be useful to organise it into a hierachy of headings. Most document writing software allow around 4â€“6 levels of headings.

Some people have expressed that this does not give them enough levels of hierarchy. If that is the case, it is in my view that person requires either additional structure, or a different structure entirely. 

Two alternatives are:

- Chapters
- Outlines
