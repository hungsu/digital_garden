# Roam Research

An [[outlining app\|outlining app]] that has gone through a great deal of controversy, for being far more expensive than competitors and for having a CEO who belittles his own customers.[^1]

On a technical level, being web-only and with no mobile app makes it hard to use on the go. Some have complained it becomes slow over time.

Use [[Private/Tana Inc\|Tana Inc]] or [[Software/Logseq\|Logseq]] instead.
