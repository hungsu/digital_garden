# reWASD

[Official website](https://www.rewasd.com/)

One of my favourite applications available on [[Private/Windows\|Windows]], and a major reason I do not use [[Private/Linux\|Linux]].

Maps keyboard, gamepad, and mouse inputs to almost anything else. Works so well that I no longer use [[Private/QMK\|QMK]].

I used it to play [[Private/CP2077\|Cyberpunk 2077]] with [[Private/Joy-Con\|Joy-Con]]s, using [[Concepts/flick stick\|flick stick]] and [[Private/gyro aiming\|gyro aiming]].

Developed by Ukrainians, who donate proceeds to defend against the [[Private/Russian invasion of Ukraine\|Russian invasion of Ukraine]]. Thus, this software disables itself if used from Russian or Belarus IP address ranges.
