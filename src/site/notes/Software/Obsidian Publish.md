# Obsidian Publish

A service to publish [[Software/Obsidian\|Obsidian]] notes to the web as a [[Concepts/digital garden\|digital garden]]. Costs $10/month, less if paid per year. I personally prefer to use Ole Eskild's [[Software/Digital Garden plugin\|Digital Garden plugin]] instead.

[Official site](https://obsidian.md/publish)

Keeps most Obsidian features, but some things will break. For example the Style Settings Obsidian plugin does not work .

## Examples

Nick Maleki's [published notes](https://notes.recursion.is/Info) has a lot

Nikola Milekic's [digital garden](https://notes.nikolamilekic.com/Welcome!) uses the default theme and the [[Concepts/scrollable tiling window manager\|sliding panes]] interface

[The Integral Guide to Well-Being](https://publish.obsidian.md/integral-guide-to-well-being/Start+Here/About) has notes about [[Private/PTSD\|PTSD]], anxiety, depression ADHD.
