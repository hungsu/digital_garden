# "Done" lists are better than "todo" lists
![yoda-do-or-do-not.jpg](/img/user/Embeds/yoda-do-or-do-not.jpg)

Todo lists and their variants are massively popular, for a variety of reasons. But their popularity hides a number of consistent issues. Todo lists almost always become [[Private/doom pile\|doom pile]]s,  causing anxiety, even [[Private/Impostor syndrome\|Impostor syndrome]] from a growing belief that they are not productive.

By contrast, a "done" list is a growing pile of accomplishment. It becomes a useful resource in future document writing, in performance reviews. In conjunction with another strategy such as a scratch pad or Time blocking, can avoid the drawbacks of todo lists while being just as or even more productive. 

## Others who agree

Walter Chen and Rodrigo Guzman built IDoneThis, a DONE list with no todo list. On adding a todo list feature, they felt the app performed worse

## Counterpoints

Todo lists are still necessary - particularly for remote workers and those with ADHD
