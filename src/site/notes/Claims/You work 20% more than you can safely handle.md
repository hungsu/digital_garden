# You work 20% more than you can safely handle

By reading this blog, you are almost certainly a *Knowledge Worker*. Not someone who does physical labour, but a person whose work requires knowledge, and generates knowledge.

Knowledge workers tend to self regulate their workload, and they often default to a simple strategy: start saying “no” when they feel stressed. The problem with this strategy, is that they don’t start pulling back until _after_ they have too much going on: leading to the 20% overload that’s so consistently observed.

The overload manifests in many forms, including but not limited to:

- Stress eating
- Emotional outbursts
- Feelings of doom and worthlessness

## Potential remedies

Rather than the common 40 hour work week, knowledge workers should consider a [[Unsorted/5-hour work day\|5-hour work day]] or [[Unsorted/Four day work week\|Four day work week]].
