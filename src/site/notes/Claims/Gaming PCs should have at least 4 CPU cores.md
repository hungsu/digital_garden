# Gaming PCs should have at least 4 CPU cores

Testing Games tested a variety of games with CPU cores disabled in their video [How Many Cores are Enough for Games?](https://youtu.be/A9e9wrnRCgk) in 2021. They observed substantial FPS drop in a variety of low core scenarios. 

CyberCPU tech counters in their 2023 [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCfP1LcFrBU&t=154s), showing as little as 4 cores being indistinguishable from 8 cores.

My own [[Gear/my computer\|computer]] has [[Gear/MINISFORUM BD790i SE Mini-ITX motherboard\|16 cores]].
