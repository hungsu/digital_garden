# Credit card churning is a bad idea

Signing up for a credit card for its signups/reward programs, then quitting once reward is claimed. 

As someone who likely has [[ADHD\|ADHD]], I believe that anyone with ADHD should *never* do this. Those with ADHD have trouble making phone calls, and are highly stressed by upsells and social savvy. What will typically happen is the credit card goes un-cancelled, incurring yearly fees that outweigh the benefits.

Neurotypical people will frequently phrase this that if you are simply disciplined and organised you can get around this. Or worse, phrase it as "no work involved". For neurodivergents, the task of "make a phone call on this day and be determined to say no to all prompts" has such a high failure rate that to call it "no work involved" is tantamount to a total lie.

If you are neurotypical and still wish to try credit card churning, you may try [r/churning](https://old.reddit.com/r/churning) and [The Points Guy](https://thepointsguy.com/).
