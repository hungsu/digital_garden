# Emailing your interviewer after an interview raises your chances

At a previous job, during the final round of candidate selection from a pool of 300 applicants, every candidate who advanced had sent follow-up emails after their interviews. In contrast, 66% of those who were eliminated in the penultimate round had not sent follow-up emails at any point.

Following up with the people you communicate with during each stage of the hiring process builds rapport. Every positive interaction you can make is an advantage you have over your competitors who did not, increasing your chances of getting to the next interview, and eventually receiving an offer.

Writing a thoughtful follow-up expressing your enthusiasm about the job, thanking the reader for their time and including anecdotes from your conversation shows strong [soft skills](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/resumes-cover-letters/soft-skills). Because soft skills are more difficult to teach in the workplace, candidates that show respect, [communication](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/resumes-cover-letters/communication-skills) and [active listening skills](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/active-listening-skills) are highly sought-after by employers. 

It will also make you a more memorable candidate as you will have had more communicative touch-points than those who did not send a follow-up.
