# There is no good reason to hate trans people

While there are _reasons_ some people and organisations give for disliking or opposing trans people, none of these reasons withstand scrutiny as _good_ reasons. They are often rooted in fear, ignorance, or rigid ideology. From a rational, ethical, and human rights perspective, **there is no good reason to hate trans people**. Hating someone for their identity is fundamentally incompatible with principles of compassion, equality, and justice.
