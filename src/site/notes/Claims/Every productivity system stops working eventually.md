# Every productivity system stops working eventually

One of the most important things to know about [[Unsorted/productivity routine\|productivity routine]]s and systems is that none are invincible. GTD, Pomodoro, [[Unsorted/Animedoro\|Animedoro]], Kanban, Agile, Pair Programming â€” all will eventually fail. This might be because external forces are too strong, or the routine isn't the right fit for the job, or many other reasons.

This means a few things:

- You should have multiple routines.
- Take note of when things fail, so that you know the limits of those routines.
- Be prepared to switch routines as soon as they fail.
- Forgive yourself when everything fails and you achieve nothing. 
- Cut yourself some slack, literally - leave days open and unscheduled.
