# Feelings are not up for debate

When trying to vent feelings, it can be tempting for the listener to question if the feelings are even real. For example:

- A: I feel ugly.
- B: You're not ugly! How can you even think that?

This appears to be wholesome feedback, but in fact it denies the venter's feelings. This is never a productive line of questioning, and almost always leads to the inflammation of feelings and sometimes to fights. 

Instead, one can **isolate the feeling from the cause**.

- A: I feel ugly.
- B: What's making you feel that way?
- A: My hair always looks terrible. No matter what I tell the hairstylist I feel like I come out looking awful. I don't know how other people have such beautiful hair.

To identify the feeling, note that feelings can usually be summarised as a single word, but a cause requires many.

One can feel:
- sad
- angry
- happy
- ugly

One can think and speculate:
- that your friend ignored you
- that you weren't treated fairly
- that rollercoaster was fun and we should ride it again

Understanding this separation between thoughts and feelings makes it much easier to manage both.
