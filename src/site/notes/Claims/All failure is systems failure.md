# All failure is systems failure

It is common to blame mistakes on *character*, particularly when such mistakes are highly visible.

- Saying that someone's work is stupid, or worse, finding its creator and calling them stupid.

Rather than helping, blaming and shaming tend to create additional problems. It is more useful for all involved to instead comment on the systems around the mistake neutrally, and redesign the systems to reduce or eliminate future mistakes.

Instead, these approaches have better long term results

- Design thinking

This philosophy has a strong resemblance to [[Unsorted/Stoicism\|Stoicism]]'s belief that things simply "are".

## Counterpoints

Some may argue that by not blaming the individual they are "getting away" with bad habits. 

Some also point out that Atomic Habits attributes a person's habits to a person's beliefs. Thus the initial point that a mistake being part of a person's character seems to hold true.

[^1]: A claim I thought about while reading [[Books/Atomic Habits by James Clear\|Atomic Habits by James Clear]], and also  [[Books/The Design of Everyday Things by Don Norman\|The Design of Everyday Things by Don Norman]] - that if you use an object and fail, it is likely the fault of the designer, not you.
