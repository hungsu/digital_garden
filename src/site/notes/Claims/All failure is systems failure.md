# All failure is systems failure

It is common to blame or praise a person's mistakes on their *character*. It is more useful for all involved to point out and redesign the systems that enabled that state.[^1]

These techniques and behaviours tend to exacerbate problems:
- Accusations
- Shaming

Instead, these approaches have better long term results

- Design thinking

## Counterpoints

Some may argue that by not blaming the individual they are "getting away" with bad habits. 

Some also point out that Atomic Habits attributes a person's habits to a person's beliefs. Thus the initial point that a mistake being part of a person's character seems to hold true.

This philosophy has a strong resemblance to [[Private/Stoicism\|Stoicism]].

[^1]: A claim I thought about while reading [[Books/Atomic Habits by James Clear\|Atomic Habits by James Clear]], and also  [[Books/The Design of Everyday Things by Don Norman\|The Design of Everyday Things by Don Norman]] - that if you use an object and fail, it is likely the fault of the designer, not you.
