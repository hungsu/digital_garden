The movie feels mostly like a chaotic carnival ride. You can expect some laughs and involuntary screams. That can be fun!

Amongst all the chaos, I noticed *one perfect moment* in the movie that I just can't stop thinking about, which is promptly spoiled. Spoilers ahead!

Claire has been separated. After escaping an enormous dinosaur, she is finding her way back to safety, in the dark and alone. Out in the darkness she hears a sound, but it's not quite clear what it is. It repeats, longer and louder. It's playful, almost cute.

It's the whistle of a dilophosaurus. She knows all too well what that sound means.

The whistle repeats, but the sound overlaps the first. There's more than one.

Claire is unarmed and surrounded by *three dilophosauruses*. She is tired and unarmed. There is no escape. To date, *every person who has heard this whistle has died*. One dilophosaurus sniffs his helpless meal.

**Chris Pratt appears and kills it.**

And here, we have one of the core problems of the movie: 

## No danger

The movie is entirely unwilling to kill or even hurt any of its “good” characters. Being the last movie in the franchise, there wasn't much reason to keep anyone alive, yet they all survive, with only flesh scratches and scrapes. The dinosaurs appear so frequently and the characters always escape, giving us no reason at all to fear them. This is even more insulting because of the next point.

## Stupid characters

> The most realistic part of the Jurassic Park series is nobody learns a lesson ever. They just keep making the same mistakes over and over again. If anything they get stupider.



There are many other things to say about this movie, but I'll leave it there. Enjoy it once, then return to the original to see movie mastery.
